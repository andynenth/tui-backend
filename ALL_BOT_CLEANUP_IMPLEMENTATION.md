# All-Bot Room Cleanup Implementation

## Problem
When the last human player disconnects from a game, the room continues with all bots playing against each other, wasting server resources.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Detection Methods to Room Class (`engine/room.py`)
```python
def get_connected_human_count(self) -> int:
    """Count the number of connected human players in the room"""
    
def has_any_human_players(self) -> bool:
    """Check if there are ANY human players (connected or disconnected)"""
```

### 2. Modified Disconnect Handler (`api/routes/ws.py`)
After converting a disconnected player to bot:
- Check if any human players remain using `room.has_any_human_players()`
- If no humans remain:
  - Unregister game from bot manager
  - Broadcast "room_closed" event
  - Delete room from room manager
  - Log the cleanup

## How It Works
1. When a player disconnects, they are converted to a bot
2. The system immediately checks if any human players remain
3. If all players are now bots, the room is cleaned up
4. This prevents bot-only games from continuing indefinitely

## Benefits
- **Resource Efficiency**: No CPU/memory wasted on bot-only games
- **Clean Server State**: No zombie rooms accumulating
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Happens as soon as last human leaves
- **Proper Shutdown**: Notifies connections and cleans up bot manager

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Create a room with human players
2. Have all human players disconnect
3. Verify the room is removed and bots stop playing
4. Check logs for "All players in room X are now bots. Cleaning up room."
