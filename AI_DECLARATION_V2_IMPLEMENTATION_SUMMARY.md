# AI Declaration V2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

The AI Declaration V2 system has been successfully implemented with separate strategies for starter and non-starter players, focusing on strong combos and dynamic thresholds.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Constants and Configuration**
   - `STRONG_COMBO_MIN_AVG = 6` - Combos with average piece value > HORSE_RED
   - `ALL_COMBO_TYPES` - Set of all valid combo types

2. **Helper Functions**
   - `is_strong_combo()` - Checks if combo average value > 6
   - `remove_pieces_from_hand()` - Safely removes pieces without affecting original hand
   - `get_piece_threshold()` - Dynamic thresholds based on pile room
   - `get_individual_strong_pieces()` - Finds pieces meeting threshold
   - `fit_plays_to_pile_room()` - Adjusts plays to fit constraints

3. **Main Function**
   - `choose_declare_strategic_v2()` - Complete implementation with:
     - Separate starter/non-starter logic paths
     - Play list tracking to avoid double-counting
     - Verbose logging for debugging
     - Forbidden value handling

### 📊 Key Strategy Differences

#### Starter Strategy
1. Find all strong combos first (avg > 6)
2. Remove combo pieces from hand
3. Find individual strong pieces based on remaining room
4. Declaration = total pieces in play list

#### Non-Starter Strategy  
1. Find ONE opener first (≥11 points) for control
2. Find strong combos from remaining pieces
3. Find additional individual pieces based on pile room
4. If no opener found, declare 0
5. Fit to pile room constraints

### 🎯 Dynamic Thresholds

Based on available pile room:
- **Pile room 1**: Only GENERAL_RED (>13 points)
- **Pile room 2**: GENERAL pieces (≥13 points)
- **Pile room 3-4**: ADVISOR_RED and up (≥12 points)
- **Pile room 5+**: ADVISOR_BLACK and up (≥11 points)

### 🧪 Testing

- **18 baseline test scenarios** - All passing
- **Unit tests for helper functions** - All passing
- **Test file**: `tests/ai_declaration/test_baseline_v2.py`

### 📝 Important Game Rules Confirmed

1. **Pairs must be same name AND same color** (not just same name)
2. **Strong combos defined as average > 6** (not ≥ 6)
3. **Non-starters must have opener** or declare 0

### 🔄 Integration Notes

The V2 function is ready for integration but currently exists alongside V1. To switch to V2:

```python
# In choose_declare() function, replace:
return choose_declare_strategic(...)

# With:
return choose_declare_strategic_v2(...)
```

### 📈 Expected Behavior Changes

1. **More conservative declarations** for non-starters without openers
2. **Better combo recognition** with explicit strong combo criteria  
3. **No double-counting** through play list tracking
4. **Dynamic adaptation** based on pile room availability

## Next Steps

1. Monitor AI performance with V2 in actual games
2. Consider tuning thresholds based on gameplay data
3. Potentially add more sophisticated combo evaluation
