## 📁 Files Created

### Adapters
- ✅ `api/adapters/connection_adapters.py` - Connection-related adapters
- ✅ `api/adapters/adapter_registry.py` - Central registry for all adapters
- ✅ `api/adapters/websocket_adapter_integration.py` - Integration layer

### Tests
- ✅ `tests/adapters/test_connection_adapters.py` - Adapter unit tests
- ✅ `test_adapter_integration.py` - Integration testing

## 🔧 Infrastructure Status

### Adapter Pattern ✅
- Registry pattern implemented
- Migration controller for gradual rollout
- Fallback to legacy handlers

### Testing ⚠️
- Unit tests for adapters: ✅ Working
- Contract tests integration: ❌ Not connected
- Shadow mode integration: ❌ Not enabled

### Performance 🔴
- Current overhead: 71% (exceeds 20% target)
- Needs optimization before production use
- Consider caching or simplifying adapter layer

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Optimize Performance**
   - Profile adapter overhead
   - Consider removing abstraction layers
   - Cache adapter instances

2. **Implement CreateRoomAdapter**
   - Most important room management action
   - Good test for room state handling
   - Includes broadcast requirements

3. **Connect Contract Tests**
   - Run contract tests against adapters
   - Verify golden master compatibility
   - Set up automated verification

4. **Enable Shadow Mode**
   - Test adapters in parallel with legacy
   - Monitor for mismatches
   - Gradual rollout based on results

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- [ ] All 23 adapters implemented
- [ ] 100% contract tests passing
- [ ] Performance overhead < 20%
- [ ] Shadow mode shows 100% compatibility
- [ ] Zero frontend changes required

## 📝 Notes

- Connection adapters are simplest, good starting point ✅
- Performance overhead higher than expected, needs investigation
- Consider batching multiple adapters before integration testing
- Room management adapters are next logical step
