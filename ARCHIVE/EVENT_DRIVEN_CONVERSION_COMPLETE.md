## 🔧 Implementation Highlights

### Backend Event-Driven Patterns
```python
# ❌ REMOVED: Continuous polling
async def _process_loop(self):
    while self.is_running:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # 10 polls/second waste

# ✅ ADDED: Immediate event processing  
async def handle_action(self, action: GameAction) -> Dict:
    event = GameEvent.from_action(action, immediate=True)
    result = await self.event_processor.handle_event(event)
    # <10ms response time
```

### Frontend Display Control
```javascript
// Frontend timer management
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    setTimeRemaining(prev => {
      if (prev <= 1) {
        if (onAutoAdvance) onAutoAdvance();
        return 0;
      }
      return prev - 1;
    });
  }, 1000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, [autoAdvance, showForSeconds]);
```

### Display Metadata Flow
```javascript
// Backend events include display instructions
{
  "winner": "Player1",
  "display": {
    "type": "turn_results",
    "show_for_seconds": 7.0,
    "auto_advance": true,
    "can_skip": true,
    "next_phase": "turn"
  },
  "immediate": true,
  "logic_complete": true
}
```
