# AI Hand Evaluation Consistency - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented consistent hand evaluation between declaration phase and turn play phase. The AI now uses **role-based piece categorization** instead of value-based, ensuring strategic consistency throughout the game.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Role-Based Planning System
- **Plan Formation**: Strategic plan created on Turn 1 when `required_piece_count` is known
- **Role Assignment**: Pieces assigned roles (openers, combos, reserves, burden) based on plan needs
- **Burden Definition**: Pieces not assigned a role in the plan, regardless of point value
- **Example**: ADVISOR (11 points) correctly identified as burden when GENERAL (14 points) is sufficient

### 2. Context-Aware Combo Viability
- **Field Strength Integration**: Imported `assess_field_strength()` from declaration phase
- **Dynamic Thresholds**:
  - Weak field: Pairs ≥10 points viable (HORSE pair or better)
  - Normal field: Pairs ≥14 points viable (CHARIOT pair or better)
  - Strong field: Pairs ≥18 points viable (ELEPHANT pair or better)
- **Consistent Logic**: Same viability assessment as declaration phase

### 3. Intelligent Opener Timing
- **Mixed Plans**: Play opener when `hand_size > main_plan_size` (30% chance)
- **Opener-Only Plans**: More flexible timing throughout game:
  - Early game (6+ pieces): 35% chance
  - Mid game (4-5 pieces): 40% chance
  - Late game (<4 pieces): 50% chance
- **Protection**: Ensures buffer pieces exist before playing openers

### 4. Strategic Burden Disposal
- **High-Value First**: Dispose of high-value burden pieces first
- **Example**: ADVISOR (11 points) disposed before SOLDIER (1 point)
- **Rationale**: Reduces risk of being forced to play valuable pieces later

### 5. Adaptive Strategy
- **Plan Monitoring**: Tracks if plan becomes impossible (lost key pieces)
- **Aggressive Capture**: Switches to strongest plays when plan broken
- **Fallback**: Maintains compatibility with basic AI for edge cases

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure Extensions
```python
@dataclass
class StrategicPlan:
    # ... existing fields ...
    # New fields for role-based planning
    assigned_openers: List[Piece] = field(default_factory=list)
    assigned_combos: List[Tuple[str, List[Piece]]] = field(default_factory=list)
    reserve_pieces: List[Piece] = field(default_factory=list)
    burden_pieces: List[Piece] = field(default_factory=list)
    main_plan_size: int = 0
    plan_impossible: bool = False
```

### Key Functions Added
1. `get_field_strength_from_players()` - Adapter for field strength assessment
2. `is_combo_viable()` - Context-aware combo viability check
3. `form_execution_plan()` - Role assignment on Turn 1
4. `execute_aggressive_capture()` - Fallback for broken plans

## Testing Results

All 7 comprehensive tests passing:
- ✅ ADVISOR as burden when GENERAL sufficient
- ✅ Mid-value pieces as burden when not needed
- ✅ Reserve pieces preserved (1-2 weak pieces)
- ✅ Field strength affects combo viability
- ✅ Plan formation only on Turn 1
- ✅ Aggressive capture strategy
- ✅ High-value burden disposal priority

## Impact

1. **Consistency**: Declaration and turn play phases now use identical evaluation logic
2. **Intelligence**: Bots make more strategic decisions about piece roles
3. **Naturalism**: Opener play timing varies throughout the game
4. **Adaptability**: Plans adjust when key pieces are lost
5. **Efficiency**: High-value burden disposed early to minimize risk

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. Implement responder strategy (currently using basic AI)
2. Add more sophisticated plan adjustment when pieces are lost
3. Consider opponent play patterns in plan formation
4. Enhance aggressive capture with combo prioritization
