# Agent Deployment Strategy - Clean Architecture Phase Transition Fix

**Document Purpose**: Comprehensive agent deployment strategy aligned with Clean Architecture principles  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Context**: Phase transition bug fix with architecture integrity preservation

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the backend architecture and the existing phase transition fix plan, this document outlines the optimal agent deployment strategy that leverages Clean Architecture patterns to ensure maintainable, scalable, and architecturally sound solutions.

### Key Strategic Insights

1. **Clean Architecture Integrity**: 375+ files across 4 proper layers must be preserved
2. **State Machine Gap**: Engine layer operates independently from domain layer
3. **Event Sourcing Opportunity**: Infrastructure available but disabled
4. **Layer-Aligned Coordination**: Agent responsibilities must respect architectural boundaries

## Optimal Agent Configuration

### **Enhanced 8-Agent Swarm Architecture**
