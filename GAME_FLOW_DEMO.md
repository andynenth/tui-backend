- Shows redeal request being processed
- System shuffles and deals new cards
- Loading animation and status updates

### 3. **Preparation Phase - Strong Hand**
- Alice receives new strong hand after redeal
- Redeal multiplier increased to 2x for scoring
- Ready to proceed to declaration phase

### 4. **Declaration Phase - Start**
- Alice (first player) declares target pile count
- Strong hand analysis suggests 3 piles
- All declaration options (0-8) available

### 5. **Declaration Phase - In Progress**
- Other players make their declarations
- Running total displayed (cannot equal 8)
- Progress indicator shows 3/4 complete

### 6. **Declaration Phase - Complete**
- All players declared: Alice(3), Charlie(1), David(2), Eve(1)
- Total = 7 (valid, not 8)
- Ready for turn phase

### 7. **Turn Phase - Start**
- Alice starts first turn (round starter)
- Can play 1-6 pieces to set requirement
- Hand selection and validation

### 8. **Turn Phase - In Progress**
