## Page 3: Game Setup & Flow
*Traditional Manual Section: "Setup" & "Sequence of Play"*

### Title: "How to Play"

### Content:
**Each Round Consists of 3 Phases:**

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Each player receives 8 random pieces
   - Check for weak hands (no piece > 9)
   - Weak hand option: Request redeal (costs multiplier)

2. **Declaration Phase**
   - Starting with Red General holder
   - Each player declares 0-8 piles they'll win
   - Total declarations ≠ 8 (forces competition)

3. **Playing Phase**
   - **Turn Structure**:
     - Starter plays 1-6 pieces (MUST be valid combination)
     - Others must play EXACT same number of pieces
     - Non-starters can play invalid combinations (forfeit play)
   - **Valid Combinations**: Single, Pair, Three-of-a-kind, Straight, etc.
   - **Forfeit Plays**:
     - Non-starters can intentionally play invalid combinations
     - Invalid combinations automatically lose the turn
     - Strategic use: dump unwanted pieces when you can't win
   - **Winner Takes All**: Highest value/type wins all played pieces
   - **Next Turn**: Winner becomes the starter for next turn
   - Continue until all hands empty

### Visual Elements:
- Flow diagram showing the 3 phases
- Example hand of 8 pieces
- Declaration dial showing 0-8 options
- Table showing pile accumulation

### Turn Order Box:
"The player with the Red General always starts the declaration and playing phases!"

### Valid Play Types (For Starters):
- **1 piece**: Single
- **2 pieces**: Pair (same name & color)
- **3 pieces**: Three-of-a-kind (3 soldiers, same color) OR Straight
- **4 pieces**: Four-of-a-kind OR Extended Straight
- **5 pieces**: Five-of-a-kind OR Extended Straight
- **6 pieces**: Double Straight (2 each: Chariot, Horse, Cannon)

## Page 4: Scoring System
*Traditional Manual Section: "Scoring"*

### Title: "Scoring Mastery"

### Content:
**Basic Scoring Formula:**

### If You Hit Your Target:
- **Perfect Match** = Declared + 5 points
- **Example**: Declared 2, Won 2 = 2 + 5 = **+7 points**

### If You Miss Your Target:
- **Penalty** = -|Declared - Actual|
- **Example**: Declared 3, Won 1 = -(3-1) = **-2 points**

### Scoring Examples:
1. **Perfect Hit**
   - Declared: 2, Won: 2
   - Score: 2 + 5 = **+7 points**

2. **Over Achievement**
   - Declared: 1, Won: 3
   - Score: -(3-1) = **-2 points**

3. **Under Achievement**
   - Declared: 3, Won: 1
   - Score: -(3-1) = **-2 points**

### Special Scoring:
**The 0/0 Achievement**
- Declare 0, Win 0 = **+3 points**
- Declare 0, Win any = **-piles won** (penalty)
- Example: Declare 0, Win 2 = **-2 points**

### Visual Elements:
- Scoring calculator graphic
- Green checkmarks for hits
- Red X's for misses
- Special golden frame for 0/0 achievement

## Page 5: Basic Strategy
*Traditional Manual Section: "Strategy & Tips"*

### Title: "Your First Games"

### Content:
**Beginner Tips:**

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Declare 1-2 piles when learning
   - Easier to achieve than higher numbers
   - Smaller penalty if you miss (-1 or -2)

2. **Count Power Pieces**
   - Generals, Advisors, Elephants are "sure wins"
   - Multiple high pieces = declare more
   - All low pieces = consider 0

3. **Watch the Declaration Total**
   - If it's 7, one player will get extra pile
   - If it's 9, competition will be fierce
   - Adjust your play accordingly

4. **The 0 Strategy**
   - Play all pieces early
   - Force others to win remaining piles
   - Success = +3 points, Failure = negative penalty

5. **Forfeit Strategy**
   - When not the starter, you can play ANY pieces
   - Use to dump low-value pieces strategically
   - Example: Starter plays 3, you play 3 random soldiers
   - You'll lose the turn but clear unwanted pieces
   - Smart forfeiting helps achieve your declared target

### Visual Elements:
- Hand evaluation examples (strong/medium/weak)
- Declaration decision tree
- Common beginner mistakes to avoid

### Pro Tip Box:
"Track what others play! If someone dumps 6 pieces early, they're probably going for 0! Remember: with 8 pieces total, playing 6 at once is a strong signal."

## Page 6: Special Rules
*Traditional Manual Section: "Special Rules"*

### Title: "Advanced Rules"

### Content:

### Weak Hand Rule:
- **Definition**: No piece valued above 9
- **Option**: Request redeal
- **Cost**: Round multiplier increases (×2, ×3, etc.)
- **Strategy**: Use sparingly - multipliers affect everyone!

### Declaration Restriction:
- **Rule**: Sum of all declarations ≠ 8
- **Purpose**: Prevents passive play
- **Example**: If 3 players declared 2, 2, 3 (total=7), the last CANNOT declare 1
- **Range**: Each player can declare 0-8 piles

### Tiebreaker Rules:
- **Same total value**: First played wins
- **Game end tie**: Most rounds won
- **Still tied**: Shared victory

### Automatic Bot Play:
- **Disconnected players**: Bot takes over
- **Bot strategy**: Conservative but competent
- **Rejoin**: Player can return anytime

### Visual Elements:
- Weak hand example (all pieces ≤ 9)
- Declaration restriction diagram
- Multiplier indicator
