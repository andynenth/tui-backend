# AI Turn Play Requirements Mapping

This document maps each requirement from AI_TURN_PLAY_REQUIREMENTS.md to our current implementation status.

## 1. Core Objective
**Requirement**: The AI must play pieces strategically to capture exactly the number of piles it declared, while following all game rules.

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- ✅ Follows all game rules
- ✅ Avoids overcapture when at target
- ❌ No strategic planning to reach exact target

## Summary Statistics

### Implementation Coverage
- **Fully Implemented**: 13 features (26%)
- **Partially Implemented**: 8 features (16%)
- **Not Implemented**: 29 features (58%)

### Priority Features Still Missing
1. **Strategic Planning**: No system to plan how to reach exact target
2. **Current Plays Tracking**: `current_plays` always empty
3. **Revealed Pieces Memory**: `revealed_pieces` always empty
4. **Opener Management**: No strategic use of high-value pieces
5. **Endgame Strategy**: No special handling for last turns
6. **Opponent Modeling**: Don't exploit opponent positions

### What We Have Working Well
1. ✅ **Overcapture Avoidance**: Core feature works perfectly
2. ✅ **Rule Compliance**: Never breaks game rules
3. ✅ **Basic Play Selection**: Chooses valid plays or forfeits
4. ✅ **Performance**: Very fast decisions
5. ✅ **Defensive Programming**: Handles errors gracefully

### Recommendation
The current implementation successfully addresses the most critical requirement (overcapture avoidance) but lacks the sophisticated planning needed for optimal play. The foundation is solid and ready for enhancement with:
- Phase 2: Target achievement strategies
- Phase 4: Opponent modeling
- Phase 5: Advanced adaptation
