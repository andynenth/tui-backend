# Forbidden Value Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI was using `min()` to adjust forbidden declarations, which only changed the declaration number but left the play_list unchanged. This created a mismatch between what the AI declared and what was in its play_list.

## Solution
Implemented `rebuild_play_list_avoiding_forbidden()` function that:
1. Rebuilds the play_list from scratch when forbidden values are encountered
2. Considers all valid combinations that avoid forbidden values
3. Allows non-starters to play single combos when avoiding forbidden values
4. Maintains consistency between declaration and play_list content

## Key Changes

### 1. New Function (lines 815-998 in ai.py)
```python
def rebuild_play_list_avoiding_forbidden(
    original_hand: List[Piece],
    pile_room: int,
    forbidden_declares: set,
    is_first_player: bool,
    verbose: bool = False
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

### 2. Replaced min() Logic (lines 1172-1187 in ai.py)
Old: `declaration = min(valid_declares)`
New: Rebuilds play_list to avoid forbidden values

### 3. Enhanced Non-Starter Logic
Non-starters can now play single combos when avoiding forbidden values, not just openers.

## Test Results

### edge_forbidden_v2_02 Scenario
- Hand: [GENERAL_RED, ADVISOR_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK]
- Position: 3 (Last player)
- Previous declarations: [3, 1, 0]
- Original intention: GENERAL (1) + THREE_OF_A_KIND (3) = 4
- Forbidden: 4 (would make sum = 8)
- New result: STRAIGHT (3) - AI correctly rebuilds play_list
- Status: ✅ PASSED

### All Forbidden Sum Scenarios
- forbidden_4: ✅ PASSED (declared 3 with STRAIGHT)
- forbidden_3: ✅ PASSED (declared 1 with opener)
- forbidden_2: ✅ PASSED (declared 1 with opener)
- forbidden_1: ✅ PASSED (declared 0)

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Declaration always matches play_list content
2. **Intelligence**: AI finds alternative valid combinations
3. **Flexibility**: Non-starters can use combos when needed
4. **Correctness**: Always avoids forbidden sum = 8 for last player
