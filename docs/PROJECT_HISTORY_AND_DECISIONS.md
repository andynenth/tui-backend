## Major Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Automatic vs Manual Broadcasting

**Context**: Early versions required manual broadcasting after state changes

**Problem**:
```python
# This pattern was error-prone
game_state.current_player = next_player
# Developer might forget this line:
await broadcast_to_room(room_id, game_state)  # Often forgotten!
```

**Solution**: Enterprise architecture with automatic broadcasting
```python
# This pattern is bulletproof
await self.update_phase_data({
    'current_player': next_player
}, "Advanced to next player")
# Broadcasting happens automatically
```

**Impact**: Eliminated entire category of bugs, improved developer confidence

### Decision 2: Phase-Based UI Architecture

**Context**: Game has 7 distinct phases with different UI requirements

**Problem**: Single monolithic component was becoming unwieldy

**Solution**: Separate UI component for each phase
```jsx
const GameContainer = () => {
    switch (gameState.phase) {
        case 'declaration': return <DeclarationUI {...props} />;
        case 'turn': return <TurnUI {...props} />;
        case 'scoring': return <ScoringUI {...props} />;
        // ...
    }
};
```

**Impact**: Much easier to develop and maintain phase-specific features

### Decision 3: JSON-Safe Serialization

**Context**: Python game objects couldn't be directly serialized for WebSocket transmission

**Problem**:
```python
# This would fail
await websocket.send_text(json.dumps(game_object))  # TypeError
```

**Solution**: Automatic serialization in enterprise architecture
```python
# Game objects automatically converted to JSON-safe format
await self.update_phase_data({
    'current_player_data': player_object  # Automatically serialized
}, "Updated player data")
```

**Impact**: Seamless object transmission without manual conversion

### Decision 4: Bot Integration Strategy

**Context**: Need AI players when not enough humans available

**Problem**: Bots need to integrate seamlessly with human players

**Solution**: Bots use same action validation and state machine
```python
# Bots and humans use identical interface
class BotManager:
    async def process_bot_action(self, bot_name: str, phase: GamePhase):
        action = await self.calculate_action(bot_name, phase)
        # Same validation as human actions
        await self.state_machine.process_action(action)
```

**Impact**: No special cases needed, bots and humans are interchangeable

### Decision 5: Room-Based Architecture

**Context**: Multiple games need to run simultaneously without interference

**Problem**: Global state would create conflicts between games

**Solution**: Isolated room contexts with separate WebSocket groups
```python
# Each room has isolated state
class RoomManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rooms = {}  # room_id -> Room instance
        
    def get_room(self, room_id: str) -> Room:
        return self.rooms.get(room_id)
```

**Impact**: Perfect isolation between games, easy scaling
