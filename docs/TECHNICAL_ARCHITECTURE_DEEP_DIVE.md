## Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Enterprise Reliability**: Automatic state management eliminates entire categories of bugs
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: All clients maintain consistent state without polling
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
5. **Developer Experience**: Patterns that make bugs obvious and fixes straightforward

### Design Goals

- **Zero Sync Bugs**: Impossible to forget state synchronization
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every state change logged with context
- **Predictable Behavior**: State transitions follow strict rules
- **Easy Testing**: Deterministic state machine enables reliable tests
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear patterns that scale with team size

---

## Enterprise Architecture Pattern

### The Problem It Solves

Traditional game development often suffers from:
```python
# ❌ Manual synchronization (error-prone)
game_state.current_player = next_player
game_state.turn_number += 1
await broadcast_to_all(room_id, {
    'event': 'turn_change',
    'current_player': next_player,
    'turn_number': game_state.turn_number
})
# Easy to forget broadcasting, miss fields, or introduce inconsistencies
```

### The Enterprise Solution

```python
# ✅ Automatic synchronization (bulletproof)
await self.update_phase_data({
    'current_player': next_player,
    'turn_number': game.turn_number,
    'phase_specific_data': updated_data
}, "Player completed turn, advancing to next player")
# Automatic broadcasting, JSON serialization, change logging, sequence numbering
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Centralized State Management
```python
class GameState:
    async def update_phase_data(self, updates: dict, reason: str):
        """
        Enterprise method for all state changes
        - Validates updates
        - Applies changes atomically
        - Logs change with reason and sequence
        - Automatically broadcasts to all clients
        - Handles JSON serialization
        """
```

#### 2. Automatic Broadcasting System
- **Phase Change Events**: Triggered on every `update_phase_data()` call
- **JSON-Safe Serialization**: Game objects automatically converted
- **Sequence Numbers**: Enables ordering and deduplication
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Complete audit trail
- **Error Recovery**: Failed broadcasts can be retried

#### 3. Event Sourcing
```python
{
  "sequence": 42,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "phase": "turn",
  "reason": "Player completed turn, advancing to next player",
  "changes": {
    "current_player": "Player2",
    "turn_number": 5
  },
  "operation_id": "uuid-4567"
}
```

### Benefits Delivered

1. **🔒 Sync Bug Prevention**: Manual broadcasts eliminated
2. **🔍 Complete Debugging**: Every change has context and history
3. **⚡ Performance**: Optimized WebSocket message batching
4. **🏗️ Maintainability**: Single method for all state changes
5. **🧪 Testability**: Predictable state transitions

---

## State Machine Design

### State Machine Architecture

```python
class GameStateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            GamePhase.WAITING: WaitingState(),
            GamePhase.PREPARATION: PreparationState(),
            GamePhase.DECLARATION: DeclarationState(),
            GamePhase.TURN: TurnState(),
            GamePhase.TURN_RESULTS: TurnResultsState(),
            GamePhase.SCORING: ScoringState(),
            GamePhase.GAME_OVER: GameOverState()
        }
        
        self.valid_transitions = {
            GamePhase.WAITING: [GamePhase.PREPARATION],
            GamePhase.PREPARATION: [GamePhase.DECLARATION],
            GamePhase.DECLARATION: [GamePhase.TURN],
            GamePhase.TURN: [GamePhase.TURN_RESULTS],
            GamePhase.TURN_RESULTS: [GamePhase.TURN, GamePhase.SCORING],
            GamePhase.SCORING: [GamePhase.PREPARATION, GamePhase.GAME_OVER],
            GamePhase.GAME_OVER: []  # Terminal state
        }
```

### State Lifecycle

Each state follows a consistent lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: `_setup_phase()` called on entry
2. **Action Processing**: `_handle_action()` processes player actions
3. **Validation**: `_validate_action()` ensures legal moves
4. **Transition Check**: `check_transition_conditions()` determines next phase
5. **Cleanup**: `_cleanup_phase()` called on exit

### State Interface

```python
class GameState(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def _setup_phase(self):
        """Initialize phase-specific data"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def _handle_action(self, action: GameAction):
        """Process player action"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def _validate_action(self, action: GameAction) -> bool:
        """Validate action is legal in current context"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def check_transition_conditions(self) -> Optional[GamePhase]:
        """Return next phase if transition conditions met"""
        
    async def update_phase_data(self, updates: dict, reason: str):
        """Enterprise method - automatic broadcasting"""
```

### Transition Logic

```python
async def process_action(self, action: GameAction):
    """Main state machine processing loop"""
    
    # 1. Validate action
    if not self.current_state._validate_action(action):
        await self.broadcast_error(action.player_name, "Invalid action")
        return
    
    # 2. Process action
    await self.current_state._handle_action(action)
    
    # 3. Check for phase transition
    next_phase = self.current_state.check_transition_conditions()
    if next_phase:
        await self.transition_to_phase(next_phase)
    
    # 4. Process any bot actions
    await self.process_bot_actions()
```

### Advanced Features

#### Concurrent Action Handling
- Actions queued and processed sequentially
- Prevents race conditions in multi-user scenarios
- Maintains deterministic state transitions

#### Bot Integration
- Bot actions processed after each human action
- Same validation rules apply to bots
- Configurable difficulty levels

#### State Recovery
- Complete state can be reconstructed from event log
- Enables reconnection with full context
- Supports debugging and replay functionality

## WebSocket Communication Layer

### Protocol Design

#### Message Structure
```json
{
  "event": "event_name",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": 1705320600.123,
    "room_id": "ROOM123",
    "sequence": 42,
    "_ack_required": true,
    "payload": {
      // Event-specific data
    }
  }
}
```

#### Event Categories

1. **System Events**
   - `ack` - Message acknowledgment
   - `sync_request` - Client synchronization
   - `error` - Error notifications

2. **Phase Events**
   - `phase_change` - Automatic state broadcasts
   - `game_started` - Game initialization
   - `game_ended` - Game completion

3. **Action Events**
   - `declare` - Player declarations
   - `play` - Piece playing
   - `redeal_decision` - Redeal choices

4. **Room Events**
   - `room_update` - Player changes
   - `room_closed` - Room deletion

### Connection Management

#### Socket Manager
```python
class SocketManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rooms = {}  # room_id -> set of websockets
        self.broadcast_queues = {}  # room_id -> asyncio.Queue
        
    async def register_socket(self, room_id: str, websocket: WebSocket):
        """Add socket to room and start processing"""
        
    async def broadcast_to_room(self, room_id: str, event: str, data: dict):
        """Queue message for room broadcast"""
        
    async def process_broadcast_queue(self, room_id: str):
        """Background task processing outgoing messages"""
```

#### Reliable Delivery
- Optional sequence numbers for critical messages
- Client acknowledgment system
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Message deduplication on client side

### WebSocket Heartbeat Mechanism

#### The Problem

WebSocket connections can be silently dropped by intermediate network infrastructure:
- **Corporate Proxies**: Often timeout idle connections after 60-120 seconds
- **Firewalls**: May close connections deemed inactive
- **Load Balancers**: Typically have idle timeouts (AWS ELB: 60s default)
- **NAT Gateways**: Can forget connection mappings during inactivity
- **Mobile Networks**: Aggressive power-saving drops idle connections

Without heartbeats, clients might not realize they're disconnected until they try to send data, leading to:
- Delayed error detection
- Poor user experience
- Inconsistent game state
- "Ghost" connections on the server

#### The Solution

The frontend NetworkService implements automatic heartbeat monitoring for all WebSocket connections:

```typescript
// frontend/src/services/NetworkService.ts
class NetworkService {
  private heartbeatInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  
  private startHeartbeat(roomId: string): void {
    this.heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
      if (this.isConnected(roomId)) {
        this.send(roomId, 'ping', { timestamp: Date.now() });
      }
    }, HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL); // 30 seconds
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Details

1. **Automatic Activation**: Heartbeat starts immediately upon successful connection
2. **Universal Coverage**: All connections (lobby, room, game) automatically get heartbeat
3. **30-Second Interval**: Chosen to be well under typical 60-120 second timeouts
4. **Bidirectional Monitoring**: Both client ping and server pong confirm connection health

#### Backend Handling

The backend recognizes and responds to heartbeat pings:

```python
# backend/api/routes/ws.py
elif event_name == "ping":
    await websocket.send_json({
        "event": "pong",
        "data": {
            "timestamp": event_data.get("timestamp"),
            "server_time": asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        }
    })
```

#### Benefits

1. **Connection Reliability**
   - Prevents silent connection drops
   - Maintains persistent game sessions
   - Works across all network environments

2. **Early Detection**
   - Identifies connection issues within 30 seconds
   - Triggers reconnection logic promptly
   - Minimizes game disruption

3. **Network Compatibility**
   - Works with strict corporate firewalls
   - Handles mobile network transitions
   - Compatible with all proxy configurations

4. **Performance Impact**
   - Minimal: ~100 bytes every 30 seconds
   - No gameplay interference
   - Negligible battery impact on mobile

#### Connection Lifecycle

```
1. WebSocket connects → startHeartbeat()
2. Every 30s: send ping → receive pong
3. If pong missing: connection likely dead
4. Disconnect detected → stopHeartbeat()
5. Reconnect initiated → new heartbeat starts
```

This heartbeat mechanism is a critical component of the enterprise architecture, ensuring reliable real-time communication across diverse network environments.

### Real-time Synchronization

#### Enterprise Broadcasting
```python
# Automatic broadcast triggered by update_phase_data()
{
  "event": "phase_change",
  "data": {
    "phase": "turn",
    "phase_data": {
      "current_player": "Player2",
      "turn_order": ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3", "Player4"],
      "required_piece_count": 3,
      "turn_plays": {...}
    },
    "sequence": 42,
    "timestamp": 1705320600.123
  }
}
```

#### Custom Events
```python
# Game-specific events for enhanced UX
await self.broadcast_custom_event({
    "event": "play",
    "data": {
        "player": "Player1",
        "pieces": [...],
        "play_value": 15,
        "play_type": "THREE_OF_A_KIND"
    }
}, "Player made a play")
```

└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

### GameService Architecture

```typescript
class GameService {
    private state: GameState;
    private eventHandlers: Map<string, (data: any) => void>;
    
    // State management
    updateGameState(updates: Partial<GameState>): void
    getGameState(): GameState
    
    // Action processing  
    makeDeclaration(value: number): Promise<void>
    playPieces(indices: number[]): Promise<void>
    
    // Event handling
    handlePhaseChange(data: any): void
    handleRoomUpdate(data: any): void
    handleError(data: any): void
}
```

### Component Architecture

```jsx
// Container pattern
const GameContainer = () => {
    const gameState = useGameState();
    const gameActions = useGameActions();
    
    // Phase-specific component selection
    const renderPhaseComponent = () => {
        switch (gameState.phase) {
            case 'declaration':
                return <DeclarationUI {...declarationProps} />;
            case 'turn':
                return <TurnUI {...turnProps} />;
            // ... other phases
        }
    };
    
    return (
        <Layout>
            {renderPhaseComponent()}
        </Layout>
    );
};
```

### State Synchronization

#### Optimistic Updates
```javascript
// Immediate UI feedback with server validation
async playPieces(indices) {
    // 1. Optimistic update
    this.updateLocalState({ selectedPieces: indices });
    
    try {
        // 2. Send to server
        await this.networkService.sendAction('play', { pieces: indices });
        
        // 3. Server will broadcast authoritative update
    } catch (error) {
        // 4. Rollback on error
        this.revertLocalState();
        this.handleError(error);
    }
}
```

#### Conflict Resolution
- Server state always wins conflicts
- Client predictions validated against server responses
- Graceful rollback for invalid optimistic updates

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Classification

#### Client-Side Errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid user actions
- UI state corruption
- Browser compatibility issues

#### Server-Side Errors
- State machine validation failures
- Database connectivity issues
- WebSocket communication failures
- Bot processing errors

### Recovery Mechanisms

#### Automatic Reconnection
```javascript
class NetworkService {
    async handleDisconnect() {
        // 1. Attempt immediate reconnection
        await this.reconnect();
        
        // 2. Request state synchronization
        await this.requestSync();
        
        // 3. Resume normal operation
        this.isConnected = true;
    }
}
```

#### State Synchronization
```python
# Server provides complete state on reconnection
{
  "event": "sync_response",
  "data": {
    "game_state": {...},  # Complete current state
    "missed_events": [...],  # Events during disconnect
    "current_sequence": 42
  }
}
```

#### Graceful Degradation
- Continue showing last known state during disconnection
- Queue user actions for replay after reconnection
- Clear visual indicators of connection status
