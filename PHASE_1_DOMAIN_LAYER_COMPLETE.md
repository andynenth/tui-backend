# Phase 1: Domain Layer Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Abstraction & Coupling plan has been successfully completed. The domain layer has been created with proper separation of concerns and no infrastructure dependencies.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Domain Structure Created
```
domain/
├── __init__.py
├── entities/          # Core business objects
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── game.py       # Game aggregate root (refactored)
│   ├── player.py     # Player entity (refactored)
│   └── piece.py      # Piece entity (refactored)
├── value_objects/     # Immutable domain values
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── game_state.py # GameState and GamePhase
│   ├── play_result.py # PlayResult value object
│   └── turn_play.py  # TurnPlay value object
├── services/          # Domain services
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── game_rules.py # Game rules and validation
│   ├── scoring.py    # Score calculation logic
│   └── turn_resolution.py # Turn resolution logic
├── events/           # Domain events
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py       # Base event classes
│   ├── game_events.py # Game lifecycle events
│   └── player_events.py # Player action events
└── interfaces/       # Domain interfaces
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── game_repository.py # Repository pattern
    ├── event_publisher.py # Event publishing
    └── bot_strategy.py   # Bot AI abstraction
```

### 2. Key Refactorings

#### Game Entity (`domain/entities/game.py`)
- Made all state attributes private with property accessors
- Removed all infrastructure dependencies
- Added proper encapsulation and validation
- Methods return results without side effects
- No direct state mutations from external code

#### Player Entity (`domain/entities/player.py`)
- Removed UI concerns (avatar color)
- Removed infrastructure concerns (connection tracking)
- Made attributes private with controlled access
- Added domain methods for state transitions

#### Piece Entity (`domain/entities/piece.py`)
- Made immutable using `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- Moved piece constants into domain
- Separated deck building into `PieceDeck` factory
- Added comparison and hashing support

### 3. Domain Services Created

#### GameRules Service
- Encapsulates all game rule validation
- Play type determination
- Play comparison logic
- Declaration validation

#### ScoringService
- Pure score calculation logic
- Returns immutable `RoundScore` objects
- Supports what-if analysis
- No side effects

#### TurnResolutionService
- Determines turn winners
- Validates turn sequences
- Returns immutable `TurnResult` objects

### 4. Domain Events Implemented

#### Base Event Infrastructure
- `DomainEvent` base class with metadata
- `AggregateEvent` for aggregate-specific events
- Serialization support

#### Game Events
- `GameCreatedEvent`, `GameStartedEvent`
- `RoundStartedEvent`, `CardsDealtEvent`
- `TurnPlayedEvent`, `TurnResolvedEvent`
- `GameEndedEvent`

#### Player Events
- `PlayerJoinedEvent`, `PlayerLeftEvent`
- `PlayerDisconnectedEvent`, `PlayerReconnectedEvent`

### 5. Domain Interfaces Defined

#### GameRepository
- Persistence abstraction
- No infrastructure details
- Repository pattern

#### EventPublisher
- Event publishing abstraction
- Event subscription support
- Event store interface

#### BotStrategy
- AI decision abstraction
- Strategy pattern
- Factory for creating strategies

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Pure Domain Logic**: The domain layer contains only business logic with no infrastructure dependencies

2. **Testability**: All domain logic can be unit tested without mocks or infrastructure

3. **Flexibility**: Infrastructure can be changed without affecting domain logic

4. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between domain and infrastructure

5. **Event-Driven**: Domain events enable loose coupling with other layers

6. **Immutability**: Value objects and events are immutable, preventing bugs

7. **Encapsulation**: Entities protect their invariants through proper encapsulation

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is set for:
- Phase 2: Application Layer (use cases and services)
- Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer refactoring
- Phase 4: API Layer cleanup
- Phase 5: Event system implementation
- Phase 6: Testing and migration

The domain layer is now a clean, testable, and maintainable representation of the game's business logic.
