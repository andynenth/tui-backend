## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for improving AI turn play strategy based on requirements in AI_TURN_PLAY_REQUIREMENTS.md. All tasks are derived from the existing codebase with no assumptions.

## Critical Bug Fix

### Task 1: Fix Pile Counting Bug in game.py ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **File**: `backend/engine/game.py` line 406
- [x] **Current**: `self.pile_counts[turn_result.winner.player.name] += 1`
- [x] **Fix to**: `self.pile_counts[turn_result.winner.player.name] += len(turn_result.winner.pieces)`
- [x] **Verification**: Ensure winner captures X piles when winning X-piece turn
- [x] **Note**: State machine (turn_state.py) already implements this correctly
- [x] **Completed**: Fixed and verified. Added `piles_won = len(turn_result.winner.pieces)` calculation.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Core Data Structures

### Task 2: Create AI Turn Strategy Module ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create file**: `backend/engine/ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Import dependencies**:
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple
  from backend.engine.piece import Piece
  from backend.engine.rules import get_play_type, is_valid_play
  ```
- [x] **Added**: Module docstring explaining strategic AI system purpose

### Task 3: Define Turn Play Context ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create dataclass**: `TurnPlayContext` with fields:
  - `my_hand: List[Piece]` - Current bot hand
  - `my_captured: int` - Piles already captured
  - `my_declared: int` - Target pile count
  - `required_piece_count: Optional[int]` - From game state
  - `turn_number: int` - Current turn in round
  - `pieces_per_player: int` - Remaining pieces per player
  - `am_i_starter: bool` - Leading this turn?
  - `current_plays: List[Dict]` - This turn's plays so far
  - `revealed_pieces: List[Piece]` - All face-up played pieces
  - `player_states: Dict[str, Dict]` - All players' captured/declared
- [x] **Added**: Comprehensive docstring and field comments

### Task 4: Create Strategic Plan Structure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create dataclass**: `StrategicPlan` with fields:
  - `target_remaining: int` - Piles still needed (declared - captured)
  - `valid_combos: List[Tuple[str, List[Piece]]]` - All valid plays
  - `opener_pieces: List[Piece]` - Pieces with point >= 11
  - `urgency_level: str` - "low", "medium", "high", "critical"
- [x] **Added**: Docstring explaining strategic planning purpose

## Phase 2: Basic Decision Making

### Task 5: Implement Core Decision Function ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `choose_strategic_play(hand: List[Piece], context: TurnPlayContext) -> List[Piece]`
- [x] **Initial logic**:
  ```python
  # Check if at declared target
  if context.my_captured == context.my_declared:
      return avoid_overcapture_strategy(hand, context)
  
  # For now, delegate to existing logic
  from backend.engine.ai import choose_best_play
  return choose_best_play(hand, context.required_piece_count)
  ```
- [x] **Added**: Comprehensive docstring explaining function purpose and parameters

### Task 6: Implement Overcapture Avoidance ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `avoid_overcapture_strategy(hand: List[Piece], context: TurnPlayContext) -> List[Piece]`
- [x] **Logic**:
  - Find weakest valid combination of required_piece_count
  - If no valid combo, return weakest pieces (will forfeit)
  - Sort pieces by point value ascending
  - Return first N pieces where N = required_piece_count
- [x] **Enhanced**: Added logic to find weakest valid combo if starter (to avoid invalid play penalty)

### Task 7: Create Test for Overcapture Avoidance ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create directory**: `tests/ai_turn_play/`
- [x] **Create file**: `tests/ai_turn_play/test_overcapture.py`
- [x] **Test cases implemented**:
  - Test avoiding strong pieces when at target
  - Test finding weakest valid combo as starter
  - Test playing valid combo even if strong when no weak alternative
  - Test single piece selection when at target
- [x] **All tests passing**: Overcapture avoidance working correctly

## Phase 3: Integration with Bot Manager

### Task 8: Update Bot Manager to Build Context ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **File**: `backend/engine/bot_manager.py`
- [x] **In method**: `_bot_play()` (around line 638)
- [x] **Add context building**: Implemented comprehensive context building
  - Gets pile counts from game state or state machine
  - Determines if bot is starter from phase data
  - Builds player states for all players
  - Creates TurnPlayContext with all required fields
- [x] **Added graceful fallback**: Falls back to classic AI if strategic module not available

### Task 9: Update Bot Manager to Use Strategic Play ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **File**: `backend/engine/bot_manager.py`
- [x] **Implementation**: Integrated with Task 8
  - Imports TurnPlayContext and choose_strategic_play
  - Uses strategic play when context is built successfully
  - Prints strategic status (captured/declared) for debugging
  - Falls back to classic AI if import fails

### Task 10: Add Import Fallback ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`
- [x] **Add compatibility wrapper**: `choose_best_play_with_context()`
  - Supports both old interface (required_count) and new (context)
  - Gracefully handles ImportError if strategic module missing
  - Maintains backward compatibility
  - Added comprehensive docstring

## Phase 4: Target Achievement Strategy

### Task 11: Implement Target Planning ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `generate_strategic_plan(hand: List[Piece], context: TurnPlayContext) -> StrategicPlan`
- [x] **Logic implemented**:
  - Calculate target_remaining = declared - captured
  - Find all valid combinations using existing `find_all_valid_combos()`
  - Identify openers (pieces with point >= 11)
  - Assess urgency based on pieces remaining
- [x] **Urgency levels**: "none", "low", "medium", "high", "critical" based on target vs turns ratio

### Task 12: Implement Starter Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `execute_starter_strategy(plan: StrategicPlan, context: TurnPlayContext) -> List[Piece]`
- [x] **Decision tree implemented**:
  - If urgency critical AND have combo that captures needed piles: play it
  - If have reliable opener AND target_remaining > 1: play opener
  - Otherwise: play weakest valid combination
- [x] **Features**:
  - Sets piece count when starter (prefers 1 to conserve pieces)
  - Prints strategic decisions for debugging
  - Falls back to weakest pieces if no valid combo

### Task 13: Test Target Achievement ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create file**: `tests/ai_turn_play/test_target_achievement.py`
- [x] **Test case**: Opener strategy
- [x] **Test case**: Urgent capture scenario
- [x] **Test case**: Normal progression
- [x] **All tests passing**: Fixed critical urgency combo selection

## Phase 5: Responder Strategy

### Task 14: Implement Responder Logic ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `execute_responder_strategy(plan: StrategicPlan, context: TurnPlayContext) -> List[Piece]`
- [x] **Logic implemented**:
  - Analyze current winning play from context.current_plays
  - Check if we can beat it using compare_plays
  - Check if we should beat it based on urgency level
  - Critical urgency: always try to win if possible
  - Medium/high urgency: usually try to win
  - Low urgency: only win if cheap
  - At target: avoid winning

### Task 15: Implement Play Comparison ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **No new function needed**: Using existing `compare_plays()` from rules.py
- [x] **Fixed**: compare_plays returns 1/2/0, not boolean - fixed all checks to use == 1
- [x] **Created tests**: `test_responder.py` with 5 comprehensive test cases

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Task 16: Track Revealed Pieces ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `game.py`, `turn_state.py`, `preparation_state.py`, `bot_manager.py`
- [x] **Track**: All face-up played pieces throughout the round via turn history
- [x] **Store**: In `game.turn_history_this_round` - accumulates all turns before clearing
- [x] **Pass**: To context via `_extract_revealed_pieces()` method that filters valid plays
- [x] **Implementation**:
  - Added `turn_history_this_round` list to Game class
  - Turn state accumulates plays before clearing `current_turn_plays`
  - Preparation state clears history when dealing new round
  - Bot manager extracts revealed pieces from turn history (valid plays only)

### Task 17: Implement Opponent Disruption ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Create function**: `check_opponent_disruption(hand: List[Piece], context: TurnPlayContext) -> Optional[List[Piece]]`
- [x] **Logic implemented**:
  - Checks if any opponent would transition from captured < declared to captured = declared THIS TURN
  - Only disrupts if that opponent is currently winning the turn
  - Uses weakest pieces that can beat them
  - Integrated as priority 1 in main strategy function
- [x] **Helper functions created**:
  - `find_current_winner()`: Identifies who's winning current turn
  - `find_disruption_play()`: Finds weakest pieces that can disrupt
- [x] **Comprehensive tests**: Created 3 test files verifying all scenarios

### Task 18: Add Burden Disposal Logic ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **In**: `ai_turn_strategy.py`
- [x] **Enhance**: Starter strategy to identify burden pieces
- [x] **Logic**: Pieces that don't contribute to any winning combo for remaining targets
- [x] **Implementation**:
  - Created `identify_burden_pieces()` function
  - Identifies pieces not in useful combos or weak singles when multiple captures needed
  - Enhanced starter strategy to dispose burdens during low urgency
  - Preserves useful combos while disposing weak pieces
- [x] **Tests**: Created comprehensive tests verifying all scenarios

## Testing & Validation

### Task 19: Create Integration Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **File**: `tests/ai_turn_play/test_integration.py`
- [x] **Test**: Full game scenarios with new AI
- [x] **Verify**: No game breaking bugs
- [x] **Check**: Pile counting is correct
- [x] **All tests passing**: 5 integration tests created and passing

### Task 20: Performance Testing ✅ COMPLETED
