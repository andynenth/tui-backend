# Project Documentation Style Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a set of editorial guidelines for all written documentation for the Liap Tui project. The goal is to ensure that all project documentation is clear, concise, and consistent. We adhere to the principles of the [Google Developers Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Voice and Tone

*   **Voice**: Use a friendly and encouraging voice. Address the reader directly using "you."
*   **Tone**: Keep the tone positive and helpful. Avoid jargon and overly technical language where possible.

## Language and Grammar

*   **Use the active voice**: For example, "The system sends a notification" is better than "A notification is sent by the system."
*   **Use the present tense**: Describe the system and its behavior in the present tense.
*   **Be concise**: Avoid unnecessary words and long sentences.

## Formatting

### Headings

*   Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to structure your document.
*   Use title case for headings (e.g., "This Is a Heading").

### Lists

*   Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
*   Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items.

### Code

*   Use backticks (`) for inline code, such as function names or variables.
*   Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks, and specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python).

### Emphasis

*   Use **bold** for UI elements, such as button names or menu items.
*   Use *italics* for emphasis, but use it sparingly.

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Terminology

*   **Liap Tui**: The name of the project.
*   **Enterprise Architecture**: The core backend architecture.
*   **State Machine**: The component that manages the game state.
*   **Phase**: A distinct stage of the game (e.g., `PREPARATION`, `DECLARATION`, `TURN`, `SCORING`).

### Naming Conventions

*   **Files**: Use `snake_case` for file names (e.g., `style_guide.md`).
*   **Functions and Variables**: Follow the conventions of the respective language (Python: `snake_case`, JavaScript: `camelCase`).
