# Room Management System Implementation Plan

## Expected Backend Behavior

### When Non-Host Player Disconnects (Pre-Game)
1. **Detection**: `handle_disconnect()` detects WebSocket close
2. **Classification**: Check `room.started == False` ‚Üí pre-game disconnect
3. **Action**: Call `process_leave_room()` which:
   - Calls `room.exit_room(player_name)` to clear the slot
   - Broadcasts `room_update` event with updated player list
   - Updates lobby with new player count
4. **Result**: Player removed immediately, room continues, no timeout

### When Host Player Disconnects (Pre-Game)
1. **Detection**: `handle_disconnect()` detects WebSocket close
2. **Classification**: Check `room.started == False` ‚Üí pre-game disconnect
3. **Action**: Call `process_leave_room()` which:
   - Detects `room.is_host(player_name) == True`
   - Broadcasts `room_closed` event to all players
   - Calls `room_manager.delete_room(room_id)`
   - Updates lobby to remove room from list
4. **Result**: Room deleted immediately, all players ejected, no timeout

### Key Point: Reuse Existing Logic
The `leave_room` event handler already implements this correctly for button clicks.
We'll extract and reuse this exact logic for browser disconnects.

## Current System Analysis

Based on the test logs analysis, the room management system is NOT handling pre-game disconnections correctly:

### 1. Pre-Game Disconnection Handling

#### 1.1 Host Disconnects in Lobby (Browser Close)
**Current Behavior** (Test 1 Results):
- ‚ùå Room is NOT closed when host disconnects
- ‚ùå No `leave_room` event sent on browser close
- ‚ùå System incorrectly treats it as "in-game disconnect"
- ‚ùå Room continues to exist with remaining players
- ‚ùå No `room_closed` event broadcast

**Test 1 Log Evidence**:
```
# Host Andy disconnects:
üîå [ROOM_DEBUG] Handling disconnect for room '48F619', websocket_id: 2535ccd1-ac50-49d4-a453-98d0c1e28e04
üéÆ [ROOM_DEBUG] In-game disconnect detected for player 'Andy' in room '48F619'
# Room continues in cleanup iterations - NOT deleted
```

**Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN - Browser disconnects not handled properly

#### 1.2 Regular Player Disconnects in Lobby (Browser Close)
**Current Behavior** (Test 2 Results):
- ‚ùå Player is NOT removed from room
- ‚ùå No `leave_room` event sent on browser close
- ‚ùå System incorrectly treats it as "in-game disconnect"
- ‚ùå No `room_update` broadcast
- ‚ùå `exit_room` method never called

**Test 2 Log Evidence**:
```
# Player P2 disconnects:
üîå [ROOM_DEBUG] Handling disconnect for room 'A011AF', websocket_id: 1e730605-cd3f-4788-b9f0-9d2fd20ec51a
üéÆ [ROOM_DEBUG] In-game disconnect detected for player 'P2' in room 'A011AF'
# No exit_room called, player remains in room
```

**Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN - Browser disconnects not handled properly

### 2. In-Game Disconnection Handling

#### 2.1 Current Implementation Analysis
The system already has a working disconnection handling mechanism:

**Files Involved**:
- `backend/api/routes/ws.py`: WebSocket disconnect handler
- `backend/engine/room.py`: Room cleanup logic
- `backend/engine/player.py`: Player state management

**Current Flow**:
1. Player disconnects ‚Üí `handle_disconnect()` called
2. Player converted to bot temporarily (`player.is_bot = True`)
3. If all players are bots ‚Üí `room.mark_for_cleanup()`
4. Background task checks every 5 seconds ‚Üí `room_cleanup_task()`
5. If timeout exceeded ‚Üí room deleted

### 3. Critical Issues Found from Test Logs

#### Issue 1: Incorrect Disconnect Classification
- **Root Cause**: `handle_disconnect` assumes ALL non-lobby disconnects are "in-game"
- **Code**: `if connection and room_id != "lobby": # This is an in-game disconnect`
- **Impact**: Pre-game disconnects are not handled properly
- **Evidence**: Both Test 1 and Test 2 show "In-game disconnect detected" for pre-game rooms

#### Issue 2: No `leave_room` Event on Browser Close
- **Problem**: Frontend only sends `leave_room` on button click, not on disconnect
- **Impact**: `exit_room` is never called, rooms persist incorrectly
- **Solution**: Backend must reuse existing `leave_room` logic for pre-game disconnects

#### Issue 3: Missing WebSocket Cleanup on Disconnect
- Log shows warnings: "WebSocket ID not found in mapping"
- Connection manager not properly tracking disconnections

## Implementation-Ready Changes

### Phase 1: Fix Disconnect Classification (CRITICAL) üö®

**File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`

**Step 1.1**: Locate the `handle_disconnect` function (around line 46-101)

**Step 1.2**: Replace the existing disconnect classification logic:
```python
# FIND this code block (around line 73):
if connection and room_id != "lobby":
    # This is an in-game disconnect
    room = room_manager.get_room(room_id)
    # ... rest of in-game logic ...

# REPLACE with:
if connection and room_id != "lobby":
    room = room_manager.get_room(room_id)
    if room and room.started:  # Only treat as in-game if game started!
        # This is an in-game disconnect
        logger.info(f"üéÆ [ROOM_DEBUG] In-game disconnect detected for player '{connection.player_name}' in room '{room_id}'")
        # ... keep existing in-game logic unchanged ...
    else:
        # This is a pre-game disconnect - treat as leave_room
        logger.info(f"üö™ [ROOM_DEBUG] Pre-game disconnect detected for player '{connection.player_name}' in room '{room_id}'")
        # Reuse existing leave_room logic
        await process_leave_room(room_id, connection.player_name)
```

### Phase 2: Reuse Existing Event Logic ‚úÖ

**File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`

**Step 2.1**: Locate the `leave_room` event handler (around line 796-890)

**Step 2.2**: Extract the core logic into a reusable function. Add this function BEFORE the `leave_room` event handler:
```python
# Add this new function around line 795, before the leave_room event handler:
async def process_leave_room(room_id: str, player_name: str):
    """Shared logic for handling player leaving room (pre-game)
    This is extracted from the existing leave_room event handler"""
    room = room_manager.get_room(room_id)
    if not room:
        logger.warning(f"Room {room_id} not found")
        return
    
    # Check if host is leaving
    is_host_leaving = room.is_host(player_name)
    
    if is_host_leaving:
        # EXISTING host leave logic from leave_room handler
        logger.info(f"üëë [ROOM_DEBUG] Host '{player_name}' leaving room '{room_id}' - deleting room")
        await broadcast(room_id, "room_closed", {
            "message": f"Room closed by host {player_name}",
            "reason": "host_left"  # Keep existing reason for compatibility
        })
        room_manager.delete_room(room_id)
        await notify_lobby_room_deleted(room_id)
    else:
        # EXISTING player leave logic from leave_room handler
        logger.info(f"üë§ [ROOM_DEBUG] Player '{player_name}' leaving room '{room_id}'")
        room.exit_room(player_name)
        updated_summary = room.summary()
        await broadcast(room_id, "room_update", {
            "players": updated_summary["players"],
            "host_name": updated_summary["host_name"],
            "room_id": room_id,
            "started": updated_summary.get("started", False)
        })
        await notify_lobby_room_updated(room_id)
```

**Step 2.3**: Modify the existing `leave_room` event handler to use the shared function:
```python
# FIND the leave_room event handler (around line 796):
@router.on("leave_room")
async def leave_room_handler(sid, data):
    # ... existing validation code ...
    
    # FIND where the logic for host leaving and player leaving is implemented
    # REPLACE that entire logic section with:
    await process_leave_room(room_id, player_name)
```

### Phase 3: Fix WebSocket Connection Tracking ‚úÖ

**File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`

**Step 3.1**: Locate the `websocket_endpoint` function (around line 151)

**Step 3.2**: Add WebSocket ID generation at the very beginning of the function:
```python
@router.websocket("/ws/{room_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, room_id: str):
    # ADD these lines at the very beginning:
    websocket._ws_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    logger.info(f"üîå [ROOM_DEBUG] New WebSocket connection to room '{room_id}', ws_id: {websocket._ws_id} at {time.time()}")
    
    # ... rest of existing code ...
```

**Step 3.3**: Update connection tracking (NO additional track_connection needed):
- The existing `connection_manager.connect()` call in the `client_ready` handler already tracks the connection
- No changes needed to `client_ready` event handling

**Step 3.4**: Update the `handle_disconnect` function to clean up connections:
```python
# At the beginning of handle_disconnect function, after getting websocket_id:
websocket_id = getattr(websocket, '_ws_id', None)
if not websocket_id:
    logger.warning(f"No websocket_id found on websocket object for room {room_id}")
```

### Phase 4: Enhance Room Cleanup Configuration ‚úÖ

**File**: `backend/engine/room.py`

**Step 4.1**: Add import for os module at the top of the file (if not already present):
```python
import os  # Add this with other imports
```

**Step 4.2**: Locate the `Room` class definition and the existing `CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` variable (around line 27)

**Step 4.3**: Replace the existing timeout configuration:
```python
# FIND this line:
CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 0

# REPLACE with:
# Timeout configuration for different disconnect scenarios
IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = int(os.getenv('IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT', '30'))
PRE_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 0  # Always immediate for pre-game

# For backward compatibility, keep the old variable name but use new logic
@property
def CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS(self):
    """Dynamic timeout based on room state"""
    return self.IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS if self.started else self.PRE_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
```

**Step 4.4**: Create or update `.env` file in project root:
```bash
# Add this line to .env file:
IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT=30
```

### Phase 5: Add Cleanup Logging ‚úÖ

**File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`

**Step 5.1**: Locate the `room_cleanup_task` function (around line 1477)

**Step 5.2**: Add logging in the cleanup section:
```python
# FIND this section in room_cleanup_task:
if room and room.should_cleanup():
    # ADD these log lines:
    logger.info(f"üßπ [ROOM_DEBUG] Cleaning up abandoned room {room_id} (no human players)")
    
    # ... existing cleanup code ...
    
    # After successful cleanup, add:
    logger.info(f"‚úÖ [ROOM_DEBUG] Room {room_id} cleaned up successfully")
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Game Disconnection Tests
- [ ] Host clicks "Leave Room" button ‚Üí Room deleted, all players notified ‚úÖ
- [ ] Host closes browser ‚Üí Room deleted, all players notified (FIXED by this plan)
- [ ] Regular player clicks "Leave Room" ‚Üí Room updated, continues to exist ‚úÖ
- [ ] Regular player closes browser ‚Üí Room updated, continues to exist (FIXED by this plan)
- [ ] Multiple players disconnect ‚Üí Room state stays consistent

### In-Game Disconnection Tests
- [ ] Single player disconnects ‚Üí Bot takes over
- [ ] All players disconnect ‚Üí Room cleaned up after timeout
- [ ] Player reconnects before cleanup ‚Üí Cleanup cancelled

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- [ ] Network interruption vs explicit leave
- [ ] Multiple rooms with same scenarios

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   echo "IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT=30" >> .env
   ```

2. **Apply Code Changes in Order**
   - Phase 1: Fix disconnect classification in `ws.py`
   - Phase 2: Extract and reuse leave_room logic in `ws.py`
   - Phase 3: Fix WebSocket tracking in `ws.py`
   - Phase 4: Update timeout configuration in `room.py`
   - Phase 5: Add cleanup logging in `ws.py`

3. **Test in Development**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   # Run through testing checklist
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs**
   - Look for "Pre-game disconnect detected" messages
   - Verify "Room closed by host" for host disconnects
   - Check that "WebSocket ID not found" warnings are eliminated
   - Confirm cleanup messages appear for abandoned rooms

## Summary

The room management system has critical issues with pre-game disconnections:

‚ùå **Host disconnects in lobby** ‚Üí Room NOT closed (BROKEN)
‚ùå **Regular player disconnects in lobby** ‚Üí Player NOT removed (BROKEN)
‚úÖ **In-game disconnections** ‚Üí Bot replacement + cleanup (WORKING)
‚úÖ **Explicit leave button** ‚Üí Works correctly (leave_room event sent)

**Critical changes implemented**:
1. **Fix disconnect classification** - Check room.started before treating as in-game
2. **Reuse existing leave_room logic** for pre-game disconnects:
   - Extract current leave_room handler into `process_leave_room()` function
   - Call same function from both leave_room event and pre-game disconnects
   - Ensures identical behavior for button clicks and browser closes
3. **Fix WebSocket tracking** - Add ID generation on connection
4. **Make cleanup timeout configurable** - Only for in-game disconnects:
   - Pre-game: Always 0 (immediate removal)
   - In-game: Configurable via IN_GAME_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT environment variable

**Root cause**: The system only works when explicit `leave_room` events are sent (button clicks). Browser disconnects are mishandled because the backend incorrectly assumes all non-lobby disconnects are "in-game" disconnects. This plan fixes that by properly classifying disconnects and reusing the working leave_room logic.
