## Summary of Improvements

### Major Wins:
1. **Baseline tests**: 100% passing (critical for regression)
2. **Combo opportunity**: Improved from 44% to 72%
3. **Opener reliability**: Improved from 47% to 67%

### Remaining Issues:
1. **Multi-combo scenarios**: Still showing large discrepancies
2. **Boundary conditions**: Not being capped as expected
3. **GENERAL_RED**: Over-aggressive in some scenarios
4. **Field strength**: Some expectations may need adjustment

## Impact of Changes

The removal of the pile room constraint has:
- ✅ Fixed the artificial limitation on declarations
- ✅ Allowed AI to declare based on actual hand strength
- ✅ Improved overall test pass rate by ~11%
- ⚠️ Revealed that some test expectations may be too conservative

The last player conservative logic has:
- ✅ Fixed baseline_08 to choose lower alternatives when forbidden
- ✅ Made last player behavior more realistic
