# Responder Strategy Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
Bots were playing their best combos when responding instead of disposing burden pieces. This led to Bot 3 playing all weak pieces early and being stuck with only strong pieces when at target.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Declaration Logic Simplified (ai.py)
- Removed complex fractional scoring (0.85 multipliers)
- Simple formula: 
  - With opener + combo: declare 1 (control) + combo_size
  - With opener no combo: declare opener_count
  - No opener: declare combo_size or 0

### 2. Responder Strategy Created (ai_turn_strategy.py)
New `execute_responder_strategy()` function with disposal priority:

```
Priority Order:
1. Burden pieces (highest value first)
2. Reserve pieces (if necessary) 
3. Openers (only as last resort)
4. Combo pieces (should never reach)
5. Any other pieces
```

### 3. Strategic Play Integration
- Responders now use `execute_responder_strategy()` instead of basic AI
- Basic AI fallback removed for non-starters
- Proper disposal of high-value pieces that don't fit winning plan

## Example: Bot 2 Turn 1
**Before Fix:**
- Played: THREE_OF_A_KIND soldiers (winning combo)
- Problem: Wasted a key winning combination

**After Fix:**
- Played: CHARIOT(8), CHARIOT(7), CANNON(4)
- Correct: Disposed 2 burden + 1 reserve, protected ADVISORs and combo

## Key Code Changes

### ai_turn_strategy.py - execute_responder_strategy()
```python
# Build disposal priority list: burden -> reserve -> openers (last resort)
disposal_candidates = []

# Priority 1: Burden pieces (highest value first)
burden_in_hand = [p for p in plan.burden_pieces if p in context.my_hand]
burden_in_hand.sort(key=lambda p: p.point, reverse=True)
disposal_candidates.extend(burden_in_hand)

# Priority 2: Reserve pieces (if we need more)
if len(disposal_candidates) < required and plan.reserve_pieces:
    reserve_in_hand = [p for p in plan.reserve_pieces if p in context.my_hand]
    reserve_in_hand.sort(key=lambda p: p.point, reverse=True)
    disposal_candidates.extend(reserve_in_hand)

# Priority 3: Openers (only as absolute last resort)
if len(disposal_candidates) < required and plan.assigned_openers:
    openers_in_hand = [p for p in plan.assigned_openers if p in context.my_hand]
    openers_in_hand.sort(key=lambda p: p.point)  # Keep strongest
    disposal_candidates.extend(openers_in_hand)
```

## Benefits
1. **Strategic Disposal**: Bots get rid of pieces they don't need for winning
2. **Plan Protection**: Winning combinations and openers are preserved
3. **Better Endgame**: Bots keep useful pieces for when they need to win
4. **Clearer Debug Output**: Shows disposal priority and what's being disposed

## Testing
