# PHASE 1: CRITICAL RULE COMPLIANCE

## SI-025: Must-Declare-Nonzero Constraint Implementation

**Issue**: AI completely ignores `must_declare_nonzero` constraint causing illegal moves
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`
**Lines**: 343-346 (constraint handling section)

### Current Code Analysis
```python
# Lines 343-346 - Current implementation
if must_declare_nonzero:
    forbidden_declares.add(0)
```

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Verify Constraint Parameter Flow
- [ ] **Trace parameter flow**: Verify `must_declare_nonzero` parameter reaches `choose_declare_strategic()`
- [ ] **Check call sites**: Examine all calls to `choose_declare()` in codebase  
- [ ] **Validate parameter usage**: Confirm parameter is being passed correctly from game engine
- [ ] **Test parameter reception**: Add temporary logging to verify parameter values

#### Task 1.2: Debug Constraint Logic Execution
- [ ] **Add constraint debugging**: Insert debug prints in constraint handling section
- [ ] **Trace forbidden_declares**: Log forbidden_declares set contents
- [ ] **Verify constraint application**: Confirm constraint logic executes when expected
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Verify behavior with multiple constraints active

#### Task 1.3: Fix Constraint Application Order
- [ ] **Move constraint check earlier**: Ensure constraints applied before main scoring logic
- [ ] **Validate constraint precedence**: must_declare_nonzero should override base score calculation
- [ ] **Add constraint validation**: Verify constraints are logically consistent
- [ ] **Implement fallback logic**: Handle impossible constraint combinations gracefully

#### Task 1.4: Implement Emergency Fallback
- [ ] **Add constraint conflict detection**: Identify when all options forbidden
- [ ] **Implement minimum viable selection**: Choose best available option when ideal forbidden

# PHASE 2: CRITICAL GAME BALANCE

## SI-021: GENERAL_RED Combo Accumulation Logic Fix

**Issue**: GENERAL_RED hands artificially limited to single combo instead of accumulating all viable combos
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`
**Lines**: 271-282 (GENERAL_RED special case logic)

### Current Code Analysis
```python
# Lines 271-282 - BUGGY implementation
if context.has_general_red and any(c[0] in ["FOUR_OF_A_KIND", "FIVE_OF_A_KIND"] for c in viable_combos):
    # Focus on the strongest combo only  ← BUG
    for combo_type, pieces in sorted_combos:
        if combo_type in ["FOUR_OF_A_KIND", "FIVE_OF_A_KIND"]:
            # ... scoring logic ...
            break  # ← BUG: Exits after first combo
```

## SI-022: GENERAL_RED Combo Enablement Filter Enhancement  

**Issue**: `filter_viable_combos()` too conservative for GENERAL_RED in normal fields
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`  
**Lines**: 135-137 (GENERAL_RED field strength logic)

### Current Code Analysis
```python
# Lines 135-137 - Too restrictive logic
elif context.has_general_red and context.field_strength == "weak":
    # GENERAL_RED in weak field acts like starter
    viable.append((combo_type, pieces))  # ← Should work in normal fields too
```

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] **Add control strength assessment**: Weight GENERAL_RED (14pts) vs opponent strength
- [ ] **Implement graduated enablement**: Scale enablement by field strength degree

#### Task 2.7: Implement Enhanced Control Logic
- [ ] **Add normal field case**: `elif context.has_general_red and context.field_strength in ["weak", "normal"]:`
- [ ] **Preserve strong field filtering**: Keep restrictive logic for strong opponents
- [ ] **Add combo quality thresholds**: Higher requirements for normal vs weak fields  
- [ ] **Balance guaranteed control**: Ensure GENERAL_RED advantage without being overpowered

#### Task 2.8: Validate Control Mechanism Balance
- [ ] **Test weak field scenarios**: Ensure existing weak field logic still works
- [ ] **Test normal field scenarios**: Verify GENERAL_RED now enables combos appropriately
- [ ] **Test strong field scenarios**: Confirm strong opponents still constrain GENERAL_RED
- [ ] **Check competitive balance**: Ensure GENERAL_RED powerful but not overpowered

### Expected Impact  
- `general_red_combo_01`: Score improvement 1 → 4 (+3)

#### Task 3.2: Design Multi-Opener Bonus System
- [ ] **Define premium opener threshold**: Confirm ≥11 points qualifies as premium
- [ ] **Calculate synergy bonus**: Design bonus scaling for 2+ premium openers
- [ ] **Implement diminishing returns**: Ensure bonus scales appropriately (not linear)
- [ ] **Balance with hand capability**: Don't overvalue openers vs combos

#### Task 3.3: Implement Strategic Synergy Logic
- [ ] **Add premium opener counting**: Count openers ≥11 points in hand
- [ ] **Apply synergy bonus**: Add bonus when 2+ premium openers present
- [ ] **Scale bonus appropriately**: 0.5-1.0 additional pile for redundancy value
- [ ] **Integrate with existing scoring**: Ensure bonus adds to base opener scores

#### Task 3.4: Validate Multi-Opener Enhancement
- [ ] **Test single opener scenarios**: Ensure no regression in single opener behavior
- [ ] **Test multi-opener scenarios**: Verify bonus applies correctly
- [ ] **Check bonus scaling**: Ensure bonus scales appropriately with opener quantity
- [ ] **Validate strategic reasoning**: Confirm bonus reflects real strategic advantage

### Expected Impact

## SI-024: Weak Field Domination Enhancement

**Issue**: AI doesn't model GENERAL_RED strength advantage in very weak fields  
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`
**Lines**: 305-318 (singles scoring in weak fields)

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 3.5: Analyze Weak Field Strength Dynamics
- [ ] **Define very weak field**: Establish criteria for strength dominance scenarios (avg ≤ 0.5?)
- [ ] **Study secondary piece viability**: When do 9-10 point pieces become viable?
- [ ] **Assess dominance effects**: How does GENERAL_RED enable secondary pieces?
- [ ] **Balance dominance vs realism**: Ensure enhancement doesn't overpower AI

#### Task 3.6: Implement Weak Field Dominance Logic
- [ ] **Add very weak field detection**: Identify when field strength enables dominance
- [ ] **Enable secondary piece scoring**: Allow 9-10 point pieces in very weak fields
- [ ] **Scale by field weakness degree**: Stronger dominance in weaker fields
- [ ] **Require GENERAL_RED presence**: Only enable with strongest opener

#### Task 3.7: Enhance Singles Scoring for Dominance
- [ ] **Add GENERAL_RED + weak field case**: Special scoring when both conditions met
- [ ] **Enable secondary pieces**: Score ELEPHANT pieces (9-10 pts) in very weak fields
- [ ] **Limit dominance scope**: Prevent excessive aggression beyond realism
- [ ] **Integrate with existing logic**: Ensure dominance bonus complements base scoring

### Expected Impact
- `general_red_field_01`: Score improvement 1 → 2 (+1)

## SI-026: Strategic Constraint Resolution Enhancement

**Issue**: Constraint resolution uses basic "closest option" without strategic context
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`
**Lines**: 348-357 (constraint resolution logic)

### Current Code Analysis
```python
# Lines 348-357 - Basic resolution logic
if score in forbidden_declares:
    valid_options = [d for d in range(0, 9) if d not in forbidden_declares]
    
    # Strategy: Pick closest valid option  ← Too simplistic
    if valid_options:
        score = min(valid_options, key=lambda x: abs(x - score))
```

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 3.8: Design Strategic Constraint Resolution

- [ ] **Balance constraint compliance**: Maintain rule adherence while optimizing strategy

#### Task 3.9: Implement Context-Aware Resolution Logic
- [ ] **Add hand strength assessment**: Evaluate hand capability for alternative selection
- [ ] **Prefer strategic alternatives**: Strong hands → higher alternatives, weak hands → lower
- [ ] **Maintain conservative fallback**: Default to closest option when hand strength unclear
- [ ] **Preserve constraint compliance**: Ensure all alternatives are rule-compliant

#### Task 3.10: Enhance Alternative Selection Strategy
- [ ] **Replace simple distance calculation**: Add strategic context to selection
- [ ] **Implement preference logic**: `strong_hand and alt > score → prefer_higher`
- [ ] **Add capability matching**: Choose alternatives that match hand realistic potential  
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Verify resolution works with multiple constraint types

### Expected Impact
- `edge_forbidden_02`: Score improvement 2 → 4 (+2)  
- `edge_forbidden_03`: Score improvement 0 → 1 (+1)
- `edge_forbidden_04`: Score improvement 0 → 1 (+1)

## SI-027: Boundary Condition Strategic Logic

**Issue**: AI declares maximum (8) for extreme hands regardless of strategic merit
**File**: `backend/engine/ai.py`  
**Lines**: 327-332 (final score constraints)

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 3.11: Analyze Boundary Condition Scenarios
- [ ] **Document extreme hand types**: Map perfect opener vs weakest piece scenarios
- [ ] **Define strategic caps**: Determine realistic maximum declarations for each type
- [ ] **Study risk vs reward**: Balance aggressive declarations vs overconfidence
- [ ] **Identify detection criteria**: How to recognize extreme boundary conditions

#### Task 3.12: Implement Boundary Condition Detection
- [ ] **Add extreme hand detection**: Identify perfect opener hands (all pieces ≥8pts)
- [ ] **Add weak hand detection**: Identify weakest hands (all pieces ≤2pts)  
- [ ] **Define strategic caps**: Perfect opener max=4-5, weak hand max=1-2
- [ ] **Preserve starter advantages**: Account for position benefits in caps

#### Task 3.13: Apply Strategic Reasonableness Caps
