# Sync Test Results - Detailed Analysis

## Test Execution: 2025-07-30 00:40

### ✅ SUCCESS: Room Creation Sync
- **Test**: Player 1 creates room → Player 2 should see it
- **Result**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**: Room ZVF7MI visible to Player 2. Host: Andy, Players: 4/4
- **Evidence**: Player 2 room count went from 0 → 1, can see room with correct details

### ❌ FAILURE: Bot Removal Sync  
- **Test**: Player 1 removes bot → Player 2 should see occupancy change 4/4 → 3/4
- **Result**: ❌ FAIL
- **Details**: Room occupancy unchanged: 4/4 → 4/4 from Player 2's perspective
- **Evidence**: 
  - Player 1 successfully clicked "Remove" button
  - Player 1's view updated correctly (4 players → 3 players)
  - Player 2's view remained at 4/4 occupancy
  - No `room_list_update` event received by Player 2 after bot removal

## Technical Analysis

### What Works
1. **Room Creation Events**: Backend properly broadcasts `room_created` event
2. **Initial Room Sync**: Player 2 receives room list updates when rooms are created
3. **Room Details Display**: Host name and initial occupancy display correctly

### What's Broken  
1. **Room State Updates**: When room occupancy changes, Player 2's lobby view is not updated
2. **Missing Event Broadcast**: `room_list_update` event not sent after bot removal
3. **Event Handler Gap**: Backend may not be broadcasting lobby updates for room state changes

## Backend Investigation Needed

Based on console logs, the issue appears to be:

### Player 1 (Room View) - Working Correctly
```
🗑️ REMOVE_PLAYER: Button clicked for player ZVF7MI_p1
🗑️ REMOVE_PLAYER: Sending to room ZVF7MI  
🏠 ROOM_UPDATE: Full data received: {players: Array(3)} // ✅ Updated
```

### Player 2 (Lobby View) - Not Receiving Updates
```
// ❌ No room_list_update event after bot removal
// Last event was at room creation: timestamp: 1753836026105
// Next event only at cleanup: timestamp: 1753836033113
```

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The backend is likely missing event broadcasting in the `remove_player` use case:
1. ✅ Room state is updated correctly (Player 1 sees 3 players)  
2. ✅ WebSocket connection works (initial events received)
3. ❌ **Missing**: Broadcasting `room_list_update` to lobby after room state changes
4. ❌ **Missing**: Lobby-specific event handlers for room occupancy changes

## Recommendation for Handler-Implementer

Focus on these backend files:
1. `backend/application/use_cases/room_management/remove_player.py` - Add lobby broadcast
2. `backend/infrastructure/events/broadcast_handlers.py` - Ensure room state changes trigger lobby updates
3. `backend/domain/events/room_events.py` - Verify events include lobby notification

The sync mechanism exists (room creation works), but room state changes aren't being broadcast to lobby participants.
