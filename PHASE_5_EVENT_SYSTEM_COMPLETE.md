# Phase 5: Event System Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Phase 5 of the Abstraction & Coupling plan has been successfully completed. A comprehensive event-driven architecture has been implemented, replacing direct WebSocket broadcasts with a decoupled event system.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Event Bus Infrastructure
```
application/events/
├── __init__.py
├── event_bus.py           # Core event bus with priority, filtering, metrics
├── event_handler.py       # Base handler classes (sync/async)
├── event_types.py         # Application event types
├── event_sourcing.py      # Event sourcing capabilities
└── game_event_handlers.py # Game-specific handlers
```

### 2. Event System Features

#### InMemoryEventBus
- Priority-based handler execution
- Support for both async and sync handlers
- Error isolation (one handler failing doesn't affect others)
- Circular event detection
- Optional event filtering
- Built-in metrics tracking

#### Event Handlers Created
1. **GameNotificationHandler** - Converts domain events to WebSocket notifications
2. **GameStateUpdateHandler** - Updates read models from events
3. **BotActionHandler** - Triggers bot actions based on game events
4. **AuditLogHandler** - Creates audit trail for compliance

### 3. Infrastructure Integration

#### Event Adapters
```
infrastructure/events/
├── __init__.py
├── event_bus_adapter.py      # Bridges domain publisher with event bus
├── event_store_adapter.py    # Integrates event store with bus
└── domain_event_publisher.py # Enhanced publisher with dual mode
```

#### Key Features
- **DomainEventPublisher**: Supports both sync (in-process) and async (event bus) publishing
- **EventBusAdapter**: Implements domain EventPublisher interface
- **EventStoreAdapter**: Publishes events after storing for reliability

### 4. Event Sourcing Support

#### Capabilities Added
- **EventSourcedRepository**: Load/save aggregates via event replay
- **EventProjector**: Build read models from events
- **GameEventProjector**: Specific projections for game queries
- **EventReplayer**: Replay events for debugging/recovery

### 5. Dependency Injection Updates

The DependencyContainer now:
- Creates and configures the event bus
- Registers all event handlers with appropriate priorities
- Wires up event publishers with bus integration
- Provides clean access to event system components

### 6. Documentation Created

#### EVENT_SYSTEM_MIGRATION.md
- Step-by-step migration guide
- Before/after code examples
- Common patterns
- Testing strategies

#### EVENT_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Complete event system reference
- Architecture overview
- Usage patterns
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Complete Decoupling**
Domain layer no longer knows about WebSockets or broadcasting infrastructure.

### 2. **Event-Driven Communication**
All cross-layer communication now happens through events.

### 3. **Extensibility**
New handlers can be added without modifying existing code.

### 4. **Testability**
Domain logic can be tested without any infrastructure.

### 5. **Audit Trail**
All events can be logged and replayed for debugging or compliance.

### 6. **Event Sourcing Ready**
Infrastructure supports full event sourcing if needed in future.

## Event Flow Example

```
1. Domain Action
   Game.start() → publishes GameStartedEvent

2. Event Bus Routes
   GameStartedEvent → Multiple handlers

3. Handlers Execute (by priority)
   - GameNotificationHandler (100) → WebSocket broadcast
   - GameStateUpdateHandler (90) → Update projections
   - BotActionHandler (80) → Check for bot actions
   - AuditLogHandler (10) → Log for audit

4. Side Effects
   - Frontend receives "game_started" WebSocket message
   - Read models updated
   - Bots scheduled if needed
   - Audit log created
```

## Migration Status

### What Changed
- ✅ Domain events published instead of direct broadcasts
- ✅ Event bus routes events to appropriate handlers
- ✅ WebSocket notifications sent by event handlers
- ✅ State machine uses NotificationService (already implemented)
- ✅ All infrastructure concerns removed from domain

### Backward Compatibility
- Frontend continues to receive same WebSocket message formats
- No breaking changes to external APIs
- Existing state machine integration preserved

## Testing the Event System

```python
# Example: Test event flow
async def test_game_start_triggers_notification():
    container = get_container()
    
    # Subscribe test handler
    notifications = []
    container.event_bus.subscribe(
        GameStartedEvent,
        lambda e: notifications.append(e)
    )
    
    # Start game
    result = await container.start_game_use_case.handle(
        StartGameCommand(room_id="test-room", host_id="host")
    )
    
    # Verify event published
    assert len(notifications) == 1
    assert notifications[0].aggregate_id == "test-room"
```

## Next Steps

With Phase 5 complete, the event-driven architecture is fully operational:
- **Phase 6: Testing and Migration** - Comprehensive testing strategy and migration plan
- Consider implementing event versioning for future compatibility
- Add event replay UI for debugging
- Implement snapshot support for performance optimization

The event system provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining clean architecture principles.
