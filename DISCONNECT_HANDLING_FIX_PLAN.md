# Disconnect Handling Fix Plan

## 1. Problem Summary

The disconnect handling system in Liap Tui is completely non-functional. When a player disconnects during an active game:
- No bot takeover occurs
- No disconnect notifications are sent to other players
- No message queuing happens for the disconnected player
- The game stalls indefinitely waiting for the disconnected player's turn
- Reconnection features cannot work without proper disconnect detection

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The `client_ready` WebSocket event from the frontend does not include the `player_name` parameter, preventing the backend from registering player connections.

### Chain of Failures
1. **Frontend sends incomplete data**: 
   ```javascript
   this.send(roomId, 'client_ready', { room_id: roomId });  // Missing player_name
   ```

2. **Backend registration never happens**:
   ```python
   # This code path is never executed because player_name is missing
   if player_name and hasattr(registered_ws, '_ws_id'):
       await connection_manager.register_player(room_id, player_name, registered_ws._ws_id)
   ```

3. **Connection mappings remain empty**:
   ```
   Current mappings: []  # Always empty
   ```

4. **Disconnect handler fails**:
   ```python
   if websocket_id not in self.websocket_to_player:
       logger.warning(f"WebSocket ID {websocket_id} not found in mapping...")
       return None  # Always returns None
   ```

5. **Additional bug - Attribute name mismatch**:
   - Code expects `room.game_started`
   - Room class has `room.started`

## 3. Impact Assessment

### Current Impact
- **Critical**: Game becomes unplayable when any player disconnects
- **User Experience**: Players must restart the entire game if anyone loses connection
- **Data Loss**: Game state is lost when disconnections occur
- **Reliability**: Makes the game unsuitable for production use

### Affected Features
- Bot takeover system (100% broken)
- Disconnect notifications (100% broken)
- Message queuing (100% broken)
- Reconnection system (100% broken)
- Host migration (100% broken)
- Game continuity (100% broken)

### User Scenarios Affected
- Browser refresh/close
- Network interruptions
- Mobile app backgrounding
- Computer sleep/hibernate
- Accidental tab closure

## 4. Objectives of the Fix

### Primary Objectives
1. Enable proper player connection tracking
2. Ensure bot takeover activates on disconnect
3. Implement working disconnect notifications
4. Enable message queuing for disconnected players
5. Allow seamless reconnection

### Secondary Objectives
1. Improve connection tracking robustness
2. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
3. Implement fallback mechanisms
4. Ensure backward compatibility

## 5. Proposed Solutions

### Solution A: Fix Frontend to Include Player Name (Recommended)
**Description**: Modify NetworkService to include player_name in client_ready event

**Pros**:
- Minimal backend changes
- Follows intended design
- Clean implementation

**Cons**:
- Requires frontend changes
- NetworkService needs access to player context

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// NetworkService needs to accept playerName
async connectToRoom(roomId: string, playerName: string): Promise<void> {
    // ... connection logic ...
    this.send(roomId, 'client_ready', { 
        room_id: roomId,
        player_name: playerName 
    });
}
```

### Solution B: Backend Player Detection
**Description**: Backend determines player identity from WebSocket connection context

**Pros**:
- No frontend changes needed
- More secure (backend-controlled)

**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- Requires session management
- May have race conditions

### Solution C: Separate Registration Event
**Description**: Add explicit player registration after connection

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Flexible timing

**Cons**:
- Additional round trip
- More complex flow

## 6. Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Day 1)
1. **Fix attribute name bug**
   - Change `room.game_started` to `room.started` âœ“ (Already completed)

2. **Add player name to client_ready**
   - Modify NetworkService to accept playerName parameter
   - Update all connection calls to include playerName
   - Ensure playerName is available in connection context

3. **Add connection validation**
   - Log successful registrations
   - Add metrics for connection tracking

### Phase 2: Robustness Improvements (Day 2)
1. **Implement fallback detection**
   - Track active WebSockets per room
   - Detect missing players by comparing with room state
   - Auto-activate bots for untracked disconnects

2. **Add connection state recovery**
   - Store connection state in Redis/memory
   - Implement connection state reconstruction

3. **Improve error handling**
   - Add try-catch blocks around critical sections
   - Implement graceful degradation

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Day 3)
1. **Manual testing scenarios**
2. **Automated test implementation**
3. **Load testing with disconnections**

## 8. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Connections
**Risk**: Changes might break currently working connections
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement changes behind feature flag
- Test thoroughly in staging
- Have rollback plan ready

### Risk 2: Race Conditions
**Risk**: Player name might not be available when connecting
**Mitigation**:
- Queue connection until player info available
- Add timeout handling
- Implement retry logic

### Risk 3: Performance Impact
**Risk**: Additional tracking might slow down connections
**Mitigation**:
- Use efficient data structures
- Implement connection pooling
- Add performance monitoring

### Risk 4: Backwards Compatibility
**Risk**: Old clients might not send player_name
**Mitigation**:
- Support both old and new formats temporarily
- Log warnings for old format
- Plan deprecation timeline

## 9. Validation and Testing Steps

### Unit Tests
```python
# Test connection registration
async def test_connection_registration():
    ws_id = "test-ws-123"
    await connection_manager.register_player("room1", "player1", ws_id)
    connection = await connection_manager.get_connection("room1", "player1")
    assert connection is not None
    assert connection.player_name == "player1"

# Test disconnect handling
async def test_disconnect_with_bot_activation():
    # Setup game with player
    # Disconnect player
    # Assert bot activated
    # Assert notifications sent
```

### Integration Tests
1. **Basic Disconnect Flow**
   - Connect 4 players
   - Start game
   - Disconnect one player
   - Verify bot takeover
   - Verify notifications

2. **Reconnection Flow**
   - Disconnect player
   - Verify bot active
   - Reconnect same player
   - Verify control restored

3. **Multiple Disconnects**
   - Disconnect multiple players
   - Verify all bots activate
   - Verify game continues

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Browser refresh during game
- [ ] Close browser tab during turn
- [ ] Network cable disconnect
- [ ] WiFi disable/enable
- [ ] Multiple rapid disconnects
- [ ] Disconnect during each game phase
- [ ] Host disconnect scenarios
- [ ] Mobile app background/foreground
