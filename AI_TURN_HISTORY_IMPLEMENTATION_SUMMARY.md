# AI Turn History & Revealed Pieces Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive turn history tracking system that provides AI with both current turn plays and all revealed pieces from the entire round. This gives AI much richer context for strategic decision-making.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Turn History Tracking
- Added `turn_history_this_round` to Game object - accumulates all turns played this round
- Each turn summary includes:
  - Turn number
  - All plays made (player, pieces, play_type, is_valid, play_value)
  - Winner of the turn
  - Piles won

### 2. Turn History Accumulation
- In `TurnState._process_turn_completion()`:
  - Builds comprehensive turn summary after each turn
  - Appends to `game.turn_history_this_round`
  - Preserves all information including forfeits (marked with is_valid=False)

### 3. Round Management
- In `PreparationState._deal_cards()`:
  - Clears turn history when starting new round
  - Ensures each round starts fresh

### 4. Revealed Pieces Extraction
- Added `_extract_revealed_pieces()` method to GameBotHandler
- Extracts all validly played pieces from turn history
- Filters out forfeits (is_valid=False plays)
- Returns simple list of Piece objects for AI

### 5. Bot Manager Integration
- Updated bot_manager to use real revealed pieces data
- Replaced empty `revealed_pieces=[]` with actual extraction
- AI now receives complete picture of what's been played

## Benefits Over Simple Revealed Pieces

1. **Rich Context**: Full turn history preserves winners, pile counts, play sequences
2. **Forfeit Information**: Tracks who forfeited - indicates constrained hands
3. **Strategic Insights**: AI can analyze play patterns, pile accumulation
4. **Future Enhancements**: Infrastructure supports advanced AI strategies

## Example Data Flow

```python
# Turn 1 plays
Bot1: SOLDIER_BLACK (1 pt) - loses
Human1: CANNON_RED (4 pts) - loses  
Bot2: HORSE_RED (6 pts) - loses
Human2: GENERAL_RED (14 pts) - wins 1 pile

# Turn 2 plays
Human2: CHARIOT_RED pair (16 pts) - loses
Bot1: SOLDIER_RED + CANNON_BLACK - forfeit!
Human1: ADVISOR_BLACK pair (22 pts) - wins 2 piles
Bot2: CANNON_BLACK pair (6 pts) - loses

# AI receives:
- current_plays: [] (if new turn) or current turn's plays
- revealed_pieces: [SOLDIER_BLACK, CANNON_RED, HORSE_RED, GENERAL_RED, 
                   CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_RED, ADVISOR_BLACK, ADVISOR_BLACK,
                   CANNON_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK]
  (Note: Forfeit pieces excluded)
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests verifying:
1. Turn history accumulates correctly through state machine
2. Forfeits are properly marked and filtered
3. Revealed pieces extraction works correctly
4. AI receives data in expected format
5. Turn history clears between rounds

## Future AI Enhancements

With this infrastructure, AI could:
- Track which high-value pieces are gone
- Identify opponents with weak hands (forfeits)
- Analyze pile accumulation patterns
- Predict remaining cards in opponents' hands
- Adjust strategy based on game progression

## Code Changes

1. `backend/engine/game.py`: Added `turn_history_this_round = []`
2. `backend/engine/state_machine/states/turn_state.py`: Added turn history accumulation
3. `backend/engine/state_machine/states/preparation_state.py`: Added history clearing
4. `backend/engine/bot_manager.py`: Added `_extract_revealed_pieces()` and integration

The implementation provides a solid foundation for sophisticated AI strategies while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
