# Room Cleanup Timeout Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Currently, when all human players disconnect from a game room (e.g., during page navigation), the room might be cleaned up too aggressively, preventing players from reconnecting. The system needs a smarter cleanup mechanism that distinguishes between temporary disconnections (page navigation) and truly abandoned games.

## System Design Philosophy
- **Bot Conversion**: When players disconnect, they're temporarily converted to bots to keep the game running
- **Reconnection Support**: Players can reconnect and resume control from bots
- **Resource Management**: Games with no human players should eventually be terminated to save resources
- **Timeout Mechanism**: A configurable timeout before cleanup (0 for testing, 30+ seconds for production)

## Current System Behavior
1. Player disconnects ‚Üí Converted to bot (`is_bot = True`, `original_is_bot` preserves original state)
2. Player reconnects ‚Üí Converted back to human (`is_bot = False`)
3. During page navigation: Disconnect ‚Üí Navigate ‚Üí Reconnect happens within milliseconds
4. Problem: Aggressive cleanup might delete room before reconnection completes

## Proposed Solution: Timeout-Based Cleanup

### Architecture Overview
```
Player Disconnects
    ‚Üì
Check if any humans remain
    ‚Üì
If no humans ‚Üí Mark room for cleanup (set timer)
    ‚Üì
Background task checks timers periodically
    ‚Üì
If timeout exceeded ‚Üí Clean up room
If human reconnects ‚Üí Cancel cleanup
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Room Class Modifications (`backend/engine/room.py`)

```python
class Room:
    # Add class constant
    CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 0  # 0 for testing, 30+ for production
    
    def __init__(self, room_id: str, host_name: str):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.last_human_disconnect_time = None  # When last human left
        self.cleanup_scheduled = False  # Flag to prevent duplicate scheduling
    
    def mark_for_cleanup(self):
        """Mark room for cleanup after all humans disconnect"""
        if not self.has_any_human_players():
            self.last_human_disconnect_time = time.time()
            self.cleanup_scheduled = True
            logger.info(f"Room {self.room_id} marked for cleanup")
    
    def cancel_cleanup(self):
        """Cancel pending cleanup when human reconnects"""
        self.last_human_disconnect_time = None
        self.cleanup_scheduled = False
        logger.info(f"Room {self.room_id} cleanup cancelled")
    
    def should_cleanup(self) -> bool:
        """Check if room should be cleaned up based on timeout"""
        if not self.cleanup_scheduled or self.last_human_disconnect_time is None:
            return False
        
        elapsed = time.time() - self.last_human_disconnect_time
        return elapsed >= self.CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
```

#### 2. WebSocket Disconnect Handler (`backend/api/routes/ws.py`)

```python
async def handle_disconnect(room_id: str, websocket: WebSocket):
    # ... existing disconnect logic ...
    
    # After converting player to bot
    if player and not player.is_bot:
        player.is_bot = True
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Check if this was the last human
        if not room.has_any_human_players():
            room.mark_for_cleanup()
            logger.info(f"All players in room {room_id} are now bots. Cleanup scheduled in {Room.CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}s")
```

#### 3. WebSocket Reconnection Handler (`backend/api/routes/ws.py`)

```python
# In client_ready handler
if player and player.is_bot and not player.original_is_bot:
    # Human player reconnecting
    player.is_bot = False
    player.is_connected = True
    
    # Cancel any pending cleanup
    room.cancel_cleanup()
    
    logger.info(f"Player {player_name} reconnected, cleanup cancelled for room {room_id}")
```

#### 4. Background Cleanup Task (`backend/api/routes/ws.py` or new cleanup module)

```python
async def room_cleanup_task():
    """Background task to clean up abandoned rooms"""
    while True:
        try:
            rooms_to_cleanup = []
            
            # Check all rooms
            for room_id, room in room_manager.get_all_rooms().items():
                if room.should_cleanup():
                    rooms_to_cleanup.append(room_id)
            
            # Clean up rooms
            for room_id in rooms_to_cleanup:
                room = room_manager.get_room(room_id)
                if room and room.should_cleanup():  # Double-check
                    logger.info(f"Cleaning up abandoned room {room_id}")
                    
                    # Unregister from bot manager
                    bot_manager.unregister_game(room_id)
                    
                    # Broadcast room closed
                    await broadcast(room_id, "room_closed", {
                        "reason": "All players disconnected",
                        "timeout_seconds": Room.CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
                    })
                    
                    # Delete room
                    room_manager.delete_room(room_id)
                    
                    logger.info(f"Room {room_id} cleaned up successfully")
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in room cleanup task: {e}")
        
        # Run every 5 seconds
        await asyncio.sleep(5)

# Start the cleanup task when the server starts
asyncio.create_task(room_cleanup_task())
```

### Configuration Options

1. **CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**:
   - `0`: Immediate cleanup (for testing)
   - `30`: 30-second grace period (recommended for production)
   - `300`: 5-minute grace period (for slow connections)

2. **Cleanup Check Interval**: How often the background task runs (default: 5 seconds)

### Testing Plan

1. **Test with timeout=0**:
   - All humans disconnect ‚Üí Room cleaned up immediately
   - Verify bots stop playing
   - Verify room is removed from room list

2. **Test with timeout=30**:
   - All humans disconnect ‚Üí Room marked for cleanup
   - Reconnect within 30s ‚Üí Cleanup cancelled, game continues
   - Wait 30s without reconnecting ‚Üí Room cleaned up

3. **Test page navigation**:
   - Start game ‚Üí Navigate to game page
   - Verify room is NOT cleaned up during navigation
   - Verify players reconnect successfully

### Logging Strategy

Add comprehensive logging to track:
- When rooms are marked for cleanup
- When cleanup is cancelled due to reconnection
- When cleanup actually occurs
- Any errors during cleanup process

Example log flow:
```
üîå Player Andy disconnected from room ABC123
üîç Converting Andy to bot
üîç All players in room ABC123 are now bots. Cleanup scheduled in 30s
... (20 seconds later) ...
üîó Player Andy reconnected to room ABC123
‚úÖ Cleanup cancelled for room ABC123
```

### Benefits

1. **Prevents Premature Cleanup**: Page navigation won't trigger room deletion
2. **Cleans Abandoned Games**: Truly abandoned games are eventually removed
3. **Configurable**: Timeout can be adjusted based on needs
4. **Resource Efficient**: No permanent bot-only games consuming resources
5. **User-Friendly**: Players have time to reconnect after disconnections

### Migration Notes

- The `original_is_bot` field already exists in Player class
- The `has_any_human_players()` method is already implemented
- Only need to add timeout tracking and background cleanup task

### Future Enhancements

1. **Per-Room Timeouts**: Different timeout values for different room types
2. **Warning Notifications**: Warn remaining bots before cleanup
3. **Cleanup Statistics**: Track how many rooms are cleaned up and why
4. **Reconnection Grace Period**: Extend timeout if reconnection attempt detected
