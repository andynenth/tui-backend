# Vertical Drop Animation Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement a **Vertical Drop (Staggered) Animation** with fade-in effect for game pieces during dealing and redeal phases. Pieces should drop from above and fade in sequentially with an 80ms stagger delay between each piece, creating a cascading visual effect.

### Animation Specifications
- **Duration**: 350ms per piece
- **Stagger Delay**: 80ms between pieces
- **Effect**: Pieces start invisible 50px above, fade in while dropping
- **Trigger**: Automatically during initial deal and any redeal

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
- [x] `PieceTray` component supports `animateAppear` prop
- [x] `GamePiece` component supports `animationDelay` prop
- [x] `PreparationContent` shows dealing animation and uses PieceTray
- [x] CSS animation system exists in `_animations.css`

### Current Animation
- Pieces use `gentleBounce` animation when becoming selectable (turn phase)
- PieceTray in preparation phase has `animateAppear={true}` but uses default animation
- Animation delay is hardcoded to `index * 0.1` seconds

## Task Breakdown

### 1. CSS Implementation
- [ ] Add `.game-piece--dealing` variant class to `game-piece.css`
- [ ] Create `verticalDropStagger` keyframes animation
- [ ] Ensure animation starts with `opacity: 0` and ends with `opacity: 1`
- [ ] Set transform from `translateY(-50px)` to `translateY(0px)`

### 2. GamePiece Component Updates
- [ ] Add 'dealing' to variant PropTypes validation
- [ ] Update class name builder to handle 'dealing' variant
- [ ] Ensure animation delay prop works with new variant

### 3. PieceTray Component Enhancement
- [ ] Add `animationType` prop (values: 'bounce', 'verticalDrop')
- [ ] Add logic to pass correct variant to GamePiece based on animationType
- [ ] Update animation delay calculation for verticalDrop (80ms stagger)
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage

### 4. PreparationContent Integration
- [ ] Add state to track animation type during dealing
- [ ] Pass `animationType="verticalDrop"` during dealing/redeal
- [ ] Ensure animation triggers on both initial deal and redeal
- [ ] Reset animation type after dealing completes

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test initial deal animation
- [ ] Test redeal animation trigger
- [ ] Verify 80ms stagger timing
- [ ] Ensure pieces remain visible after animation
- [ ] Test with different hand sizes (8 pieces)
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with turn phase animations

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Dependencies
1. **CSS Animation System**: Relies on existing animation infrastructure
2. **Component Props**: Requires prop drilling through PreparationUI → PreparationContent → PieceTray → GamePiece
3. **Dealing State**: Depends on `dealingCards` prop from backend

### Potential Blockers
1. **Animation Conflicts**: Need to ensure new animation doesn't interfere with existing `gentleBounce`
2. **Timing Synchronization**: Animation should complete within dealing phase (3.5s)
3. **State Management**: Must handle rapid redeal scenarios without animation glitches

## Implementation Notes

### Animation CSS Structure
```css
.game-piece--dealing {
  animation: verticalDropStagger 0.35s ease-out forwards;
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-50px);
}

@keyframes verticalDropStagger {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-50px);
  }
  20% {
    opacity: 0.5;
    transform: translateY(-30px);
  }
  60% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0px);
  }
}
```

### Component Flow
```
PreparationContent (tracks dealing state)
  └── PieceTray (animationType="verticalDrop")
      └── GamePiece (variant="dealing", animationDelay={index * 0.08})
```
