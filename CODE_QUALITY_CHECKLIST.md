  - Grouped endpoints with tags (rooms, game, health, events, recovery)
  - **Impact**: Better API discoverability and usability

- [x] **Standardize error handling** 🔴 Critical ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created StandardError class and ErrorCode enum
  - Implemented ErrorHandlingService for centralized error management
  - Updated all endpoints to use consistent error format
  - Created frontend error parsing utilities
  - **Impact**: Consistent error experience across the application

### 🔄 In Progress / Pending Tasks

#### High-Impact Improvements (1-2 days each)
- [ ] **TypeScript Enhancement** 🟢 Nice to have
  - Current hybrid approach (JSX + TS for services) is working well
  - Consider TSX migration only if experiencing prop-related bugs
  - Focus on adding type hints to Python backend instead
  - **Impact**: Better developer experience without major refactor

- [ ] **Component size optimization** 🟢 Nice to have
  - Break down GameContainer (472 lines) and TurnContent (374 lines)
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - **Impact**: Easier testing and maintenance

- [ ] **Add coverage badges to README** 🟢 Nice to have
  - Frontend and backend coverage visualization
  - **Impact**: Visible quality metrics

#### Critical Missing Tests
- [ ] **No API service tests** 🔴
  - GameService.ts has no test coverage
  - NetworkService.ts has no test coverage
  - Critical for reliability
  - **Subtasks:**
    - [ ] Set up mock WebSocket and fetch utilities
    - [ ] Test GameService.ts (getRooms, createRoom, joinRoom, startGame)
    - [ ] Test NetworkService.ts (connection, messaging, reconnection, queuing)
    - [ ] Ensure error handling coverage

#### Architecture & Infrastructure
- [ ] **No CI/CD pipeline** 🟡
  - Manual deployment process
  - No automated testing on PR
  - No automatic linting checks

- [ ] **Missing monitoring** 🟡
  - No error tracking (Sentry)
  - No performance monitoring
  - Only basic health checks

- [ ] **No rate limiting** 🔴 HIGH RISK - DO LAST
  - WebSocket connections unlimited
  - API endpoints have no rate limits
  - **Warning**: Previous implementation broke WebSocket connections
  - **Recommendation**: Complete all other tasks first

## 📊 Metrics & Tracking

### Current Baseline (January 2025)
| Metric | Frontend | Backend | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| Linting Issues | 0 ✅ | 0 ✅ | < 50 |
| Test Coverage | jest --coverage ✅ | pytest-cov ready ✅ | > 80% |
| Test Files | 30 | 79 | Growing |
| Documentation | Partial | Good ✅ | Complete |
| Type Safety | Good | Partial | Excellent |
| Dead Code | 0 ✅ | 0 ✅ | 0 |
| API Documentation | N/A | Complete ✅ | Complete |
| Error Handling | Standardized ✅ | Standardized ✅ | Consistent |

### How to Measure
```bash
# Frontend metrics
npm run lint 2>&1 | grep -E "error|warning" | wc -l
npm run test:coverage

# Backend metrics
cd backend && pylint engine/ api/ --exit-zero
cd backend && pytest --cov=engine --cov=api

# Documentation coverage
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --exclude-dir=node_modules . | wc -l
```

## 🎯 Getting Started Guide

### TypeScript Strategy
This project uses a **pragmatic hybrid approach**:
- **UI Components**: `.jsx` files with PropTypes for runtime validation
- **Business Logic**: `.ts` files for services, hooks, and utilities
- **Why**: This provides type safety where it matters most while keeping UI components simple

### For New Team Members
1. **First Day**
   - Run `npm run format:fix` to see code style
   - Run `npm run lint` to understand rules
   - Review completed items in Priority Action Items

2. **First Week**
   - Add documentation to one component
   - Write tests for one feature
   - Fix any new linting issues

3. **First Month**
   - Lead one code quality improvement
   - Update this checklist with learnings
   - Mentor another developer on quality standards

### Daily Quality Habits
- ✅ Run linters before committing
- ✅ Write tests for new features
- ✅ Document complex logic
- ✅ Review PR against this checklist
