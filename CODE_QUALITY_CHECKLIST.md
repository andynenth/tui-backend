## 🚀 Priority Action Items

### Immediate Quick Wins (1-2 hours each)
- [ ] **Fix 4,322 Linting Issues** 🔴 Critical
  - Frontend (2,637 issues): Run `npm run format:fix` then `npm run lint:fix`
  - Backend (1,685 issues): Run `black .` in backend directory
  - Review remaining manual fixes needed
  - **Impact**: Instant code consistency, better readability

  - Add coverage badges to README
  - **Impact**: Visibility into test gaps

- [ ] **Fix Python imports and docstrings** 🟡 Important
  - Reorganize imports: standard lib → third-party → local
  - Add docstrings to public functions (many missing)
  - **Impact**: Better code maintainability and IDE support

### High-Impact Improvements (1-2 days each)
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** 🔴 Critical
  - Add rate limiting to WebSocket connections
  - Implement API endpoint rate limits
  - **Impact**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

- [ ] **Extract magic numbers to constants** 🟡 Important

### Long-term Initiatives (1+ week)
- [ ] **TypeScript Enhancement** 🟢 Nice to have
  - Current hybrid approach (JSX + TS for services) is working well
  - Consider TSX migration only if experiencing prop-related bugs
  - Focus on adding type hints to Python backend instead
  - **Impact**: Better developer experience without major refactor

- [ ] **Component size optimization** 🟢 Nice to have
  - Break down GameContainer (472 lines) and TurnContent (374 lines)
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - **Impact**: Easier testing and maintenance
  - Improve type safety
  - **Impact**: Easier maintenance

## 🎯 Getting Started Guide

### TypeScript Strategy
This project uses a **pragmatic hybrid approach**:
- **UI Components**: `.jsx` files with PropTypes for runtime validation
- **Business Logic**: `.ts` files for services, hooks, and utilities
- **Why**: This provides type safety where it matters most while keeping UI components simple

This approach is working well - no need to convert JSX to TSX unless experiencing specific issues.

### For New Team Members
1. **First Day**
   - Run `npm run format:fix` to see code style
   - Run `npm run lint` to understand rules
   - Review this checklist's Priority Action Items

2. **First Week**
   - Fix at least 50 ESLint issues
   - Add documentation to one component
   - Write tests for one feature

3. **First Month**
