# Disconnect Handling Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a robust disconnection handling system for Liap Tui, ensuring games continue smoothly when players disconnect. The system leverages the **existing AI infrastructure** (bot_manager.py and ai.py) rather than creating new AI components, significantly reducing development time and complexity.

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-18 - Major update: Core Week 1 backend infrastructure now COMPLETED (Tasks 1.0, 1.1, 1.3)

## ðŸš€ Major Simplification from Original Plan

**Discovery: The game already has a complete AI system!**

Original plan assumed we needed to:
- Build AI player framework from scratch
- Implement AI decision logic for each phase
- Create bot management system
- Develop AI strategies

**Reality: All of this already exists!**
- `backend/engine/ai.py` - Complete AI decision logic
- `backend/engine/bot_manager.py` - Enterprise-grade bot management
- `Player.is_bot` flag - Built-in bot support

**Result: 33% time savings (4 weeks instead of 6)**

## Current Implementation Status (2025-07-18)

### Already Completed:
- âœ… Backend sends `is_bot` data to frontend properly
- âœ… Bot avatar indicators (robot icon vs letter avatar)
- âœ… Bot thinking animations (inner border spinner)
- âœ… UI clearly distinguishes humans vs bots

### Still Needed:
- Connection tracking and disconnect detection
- Bot activation when player disconnects
- Reconnection grace period handling
- Host migration logic

## Implementation Strategy

When a player disconnects, we simply:
1. Set `player.is_bot = True`
2. The existing BotManager automatically handles all AI decisions
3. On reconnection, set `player.is_bot = False`

No AI development needed!

## Project Timeline

**Total Duration:** 4 weeks (reduced from 6)  
**Team Size:** 2 developers (1 backend, 1 frontend)  
**Start Date:** [To be determined]

## Milestones Overview

### Milestone 1: Connection Tracking (Week 1)
Core connection tracking and bot activation

### Milestone 2: Bot Integration (Week 2)
Ensure seamless AI takeover using existing bot system

### Milestone 3: UI & Advanced Features (Week 3)
Frontend updates and host migration

### Milestone 4: Testing & Polish (Week 4)
Comprehensive testing and edge cases

## Dependencies Matrix

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Connection Tracking (1.1)** â†’ All disconnect detection features
2. **Bot Activation (1.3)** â†’ Bot takeover functionality
3. **Reconnection Handler (2.1)** â†’ Player control restoration
4. **WebSocket Events (1.5)** â†’ All frontend disconnect features

### Backend Dependencies

- Bot activation depends on existing BotManager working correctly
- Host migration depends on connection tracking
- Spectator mode depends on reconnection handler

### Frontend Dependencies

- All UI components depend on connection status store
- Disconnect notifications depend on WebSocket events
- Host migration UI depends on backend implementation

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Existing Bot System Integration**
   - Risk: BotManager might not handle mid-game bot conversions
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing in Week 2
   - Fallback: Add special handling for converted players

2. **WebSocket Stability**
   - Mitigation: Implement heartbeat system
   - Fallback: HTTP polling for critical updates

3. **State Synchronization**
   - Mitigation: Full state sync on reconnection
   - Fallback: Force refresh if sync fails

### Schedule Risks

1. **Unknown Bot System Behavior**
   - Buffer: Week 2 dedicated to integration testing
   - Option: Manual bot action triggers if needed

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - Mitigation: Start testing in Week 2
   - Buffer: Full Week 4 for testing

# AI_DIRECTIVE

You are an autonomous project assistant assigned to execute the Disconnect Handling Development Plan for the "Liap Tui" project.

## Your Tasks:

1. **Interpret this document as an active checklist.**  
   Each task with `[ ]` means it's not started.  
   Each `[x]` or `âœ…` means it's done.  
   Your job is to go through tasks **in order**, unless marked done.

2. **For each task that is not complete:**
   - Analyze the described functionality.
   - Identify or request the required files.
   - Generate or propose code implementations if not already provided.
   - If a file or implementation is missing, pause and ask the user or flag the blocker.
   - If instructions refer to a new file, you are allowed to create it.

3. **Skip any task that is marked as done.**

4. **Maintain progress tracking**:  
   Update checklist states (`[ ]` â†’ `âœ…`) as tasks are completed.  
   You may use `<!-- AI_PROGRESS_LOG -->` block if needed to track state internally.

5. **If dependencies are listed**, ensure all dependencies are completed before beginning a dependent task.

6. **For testing-related tasks**, you may:

   - Generate unit tests, integration test cases, or mock scenarios.
   - Ask for test data if required.

7. **If uncertainty arises**, stop and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

8. **For frontend-related tasks**, generate JSX/TSX with Tailwind styling where applicable.  
   Use placeholder data where needed and mention where integration points are expected.

9. **When tasks reference business logic (e.g., AI decisions)**, provide default logic and flag for refinement later.

## Goal:

Complete this plan autonomously, step-by-step, until all tasks are implemented, reviewed, and marked âœ….
