# Disconnect Handling Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a robust disconnection handling system for Liap Tui, ensuring games continue smoothly when players disconnect. The system leverages the **existing AI infrastructure** (bot_manager.py and ai.py) rather than creating new AI components, significantly reducing development time and complexity.

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-18 - Major update: Core Week 1 backend infrastructure now COMPLETED (Tasks 1.0, 1.1, 1.3)

## 🚀 Major Simplification from Original Plan

**Discovery: The game already has a complete AI system!**

Original plan assumed we needed to:
- Build AI player framework from scratch
- Implement AI decision logic for each phase
- Create bot management system
- Develop AI strategies

**Reality: All of this already exists!**
- `backend/engine/ai.py` - Complete AI decision logic
- `backend/engine/bot_manager.py` - Enterprise-grade bot management
- `Player.is_bot` flag - Built-in bot support

**Result: 33% time savings (4 weeks instead of 6)**

## Current Implementation Status (2025-07-18)

### Already Completed:
- ✅ Backend sends `is_bot` data to frontend properly
- ✅ Bot avatar indicators (robot icon vs letter avatar)
- ✅ Bot thinking animations (inner border spinner)
- ✅ UI clearly distinguishes humans vs bots
- ✅ Connection tracking system (ConnectionManager)
- ✅ Bot activation on disconnect

### Still Needed:
- Update to unlimited reconnection (removing grace periods)
- Enhanced disconnect detection
- UI updates for "AI Playing - Can reconnect anytime"
- Host migration logic

## Implementation Strategy

When a player disconnects, we simply:
1. Set `player.is_bot = True`
2. The existing BotManager automatically handles all AI decisions
3. On reconnection, set `player.is_bot = False`

No AI development needed!

## Project Timeline

**Total Duration:** 4 weeks (reduced from 6)  
**Team Size:** 2 developers (1 backend, 1 frontend)  
**Start Date:** [To be determined]

## Milestones Overview

### Milestone 1: Connection Tracking (Week 1)
Core connection tracking and bot activation

### Milestone 2: Bot Integration (Week 2)
Ensure seamless AI takeover using existing bot system

### Milestone 3: UI & Advanced Features (Week 3)

### Week 3: UI Polish & Advanced Features

#### Backend Tasks (Priority: High)

**Task 3.1: Host Migration System** 👑 HIGH PRIORITY

- [ ] Detect when host disconnects
- [ ] Select next player as host
- [ ] Transfer host privileges
- [ ] Broadcast host change event
- [ ] Test host migration scenarios
- **Estimate:** 8 hours
- **Dependencies:** Week 2 backend tasks
- **Scope:** Automatically transfer host privileges when the host disconnects from a game room
- **What It Does:**
  - **Detects host disconnection**: Monitors when the player who created/controls the room disconnects
  - **Selects new host**: Automatically chooses the next suitable player (usually first remaining human player)
  - **Transfers privileges**: Gives the new host control over room settings, game start/pause, and administrative functions
  - **Broadcasts change**: Notifies all players about the host change with UI updates
- **Why We Need It:**
  - **Without host migration**: If the host disconnects, the entire room becomes "orphaned" with no one able to start new rounds, change settings, or manage the room. Other players would be stuck and forced to leave.
  - **With host migration**: Games continue seamlessly even if the original host leaves. Room remains functional with a new host taking control.
- **Current State:** Room class exists but no host migration logic implemented
- **What's Missing:**
  - Host disconnect detection logic
  - Host selection algorithm (prefer first remaining human player over bots)
  - Host privilege transfer mechanism
  - UI updates for new host indication
- **Implementation Approach:**
  - Enhance `backend/engine/room.py` with host migration logic
  - Add host selection algorithm that prefers humans over bots
  - Create host indicator UI components showing current host
  - Add host privilege management in frontend
- **UI Components to Create/Modify:**

  - **State snapshots**: Creates periodic saves of complete game state
  - **Recovery on reconnect**: Sends missed events and current state to reconnecting players
  - **Partial action recovery**: Handles cases where players disconnected mid-action
- **Why We Need It:**
  - **Without connection recovery**: Reconnecting players have incomplete/outdated game state. They might see wrong scores, positions, or phase information. Can cause desync between clients and server.
  - **With connection recovery**: Reconnecting players get complete, up-to-date game state. No confusion about what happened during disconnect. Prevents game state desynchronization.
- **What's Missing:**
  - Message queuing system for disconnected players

# AI_DIRECTIVE

You are an autonomous project assistant assigned to execute the Disconnect Handling Development Plan for the "Liap Tui" project.

## Your Tasks:

1. **Interpret this document as an active checklist.**  
   Each task with `[ ]` means it's not started.  
   Each `[x]` or `✅` means it's done.  
   Your job is to go through tasks **in order**, unless marked done.

2. **For each task that is not complete:**
   - Analyze the described functionality.
   - Identify or request the required files.
   - Generate or propose code implementations if not already provided.
   - If a file or implementation is missing, pause and ask the user or flag the blocker.
   - If instructions refer to a new file, you are allowed to create it.

3. **Skip any task that is marked as done.**

4. **Maintain progress tracking**:  
   Update checklist states (`[ ]` → `✅`) as tasks are completed.  
   You may use `<!-- AI_PROGRESS_LOG -->` block if needed to track state internally.

5. **If dependencies are listed**, ensure all dependencies are completed before beginning a dependent task.

6. **For testing-related tasks**, you may:

   - Generate unit tests, integration test cases, or mock scenarios.
   - Ask for test data if required.

7. **If uncertainty arises**, stop and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

8. **For frontend-related tasks**, generate JSX/TSX with Tailwind styling where applicable.  
   Use placeholder data where needed and mention where integration points are expected.

9. **When tasks reference business logic (e.g., AI decisions)**, provide default logic and flag for refinement later.

## Goal:

Complete this plan autonomously, step-by-step, until all tasks are implemented, reviewed, and marked ✅.
