# AI System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Liap TUI game implements a sophisticated AI system that powers bot players with strategic decision-making capabilities. The AI system consists of multiple components working together to create intelligent, context-aware gameplay that rivals human players.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core AI Decision Engine (`backend/engine/ai.py`)

The heart of the AI system is a strategic decision engine that makes intelligent declarations and play choices.

#### Strategic Declaration System

The AI uses a **9-phase decision process** for declarations:

1. **Context Building** - Gathers game state information
2. **Combo Discovery** - Finds all valid piece combinations  
3. **Opener Evaluation** - Assesses high-value pieces (11+ points)
4. **Combo Filtering** - Determines which combos are actually playable
5. **Base Score Calculation** - Counts viable piles from combos and openers
6. **Strategic Adjustments** - Applies context-specific modifiers
7. **Constraint Application** - Respects game rules and pile room limits
8. **Forbidden Value Handling** - Avoids illegal declarations
9. **Final Validation** - Ensures declaration is valid and optimal

#### Key Classes and Data Structures

```python
@dataclass
class DeclarationContext:
    """Holds all strategic context for declaration decisions"""
    position_in_order: int        # 0-3 (declaration position)
    previous_declarations: List[int]  # What others declared
    is_starter: bool              # First player advantage
    pile_room: int               # Available pile space (8 - sum(previous))
    field_strength: str          # "weak", "normal", "strong"
    has_general_red: bool        # Game-changing piece detection
    opponent_patterns: Dict      # Analyzed opponent capabilities
```

#### Strategic Algorithms

**Pile Room Constraint (Absolute)**
```python
pile_room = max(0, 8 - sum(previous_declarations))
score = min(score, pile_room)  # Hard ceiling
```

**Field Strength Assessment**
```python
avg_declaration = sum(previous_declarations) / len(previous_declarations)
if avg_declaration <= 1.0: return "weak"      # Opponents have poor hands
elif avg_declaration >= 3.5: return "strong"  # Opponents have excellent hands  
else: return "normal"
```

**Combo Viability Analysis**
- **Starter**: Can play any valid combo
- **GENERAL_RED in weak field**: Acts like starter
- **Non-starters**: Need combo opportunities from opponents
- **Singles-only opponents**: Provide 0% combo opportunity

#### Advanced Features

1. **GENERAL_RED Game Changer**: When holding the strongest piece (14 points) in a weak field, the AI can execute combos that would normally be unplayable.

2. **Context-Aware Opener Valuation**: 
   - GENERAL (13-14 points): Always reliable (100%)
   - ADVISOR (11-12 points): Reliability varies by field strength (70-100%)

3. **Overlapping Combo Prevention**: Prioritizes FIVE_OF_A_KIND over THREE_OF_A_KIND when using same pieces.

4. **Strategic Focus with GENERAL_RED**: Concentrates on one strong combo rather than multiple weaker ones.

### 2. Async Strategy Wrapper (`backend/engine/async_bot_strategy.py`)

Provides non-blocking AI operations for better performance:

```python
class AsyncBotStrategy:
    async def choose_declaration(self, hand, is_first_player, position_in_order, 
                               previous_declarations, must_declare_nonzero=False):
        # Runs CPU-intensive AI decision in thread pool
        return await loop.run_in_executor(None, ai.choose_declare, ...)
        
    async def choose_best_play(self, hand, required_count=None):
        # Async play selection with performance monitoring
        
    async def should_accept_redeal(self, hand, round_number, current_score, opponent_scores):
        # Intelligent redeal decisions based on hand strength and game state
```

**Performance Features:**
- Thread pool execution to avoid blocking the main event loop
- Decision caching with TTL for repeated scenarios
- Performance metrics logging (sub-100ms decisions)
- Concurrent decision simulation for testing

### 3. Bot Lifecycle Management (`backend/engine/bot_manager.py`)

Manages bot behavior throughout the game lifecycle using enterprise architecture patterns.

#### Core Responsibilities

1. **Game Registration**: Associates bots with specific game rooms
2. **Event Handling**: Responds to game events (phase changes, player actions)
3. **Action Sequencing**: Ensures bots act in proper turn order with realistic delays
4. **Race Condition Prevention**: Sophisticated deduplication system
5. **Enterprise Integration**: Works seamlessly with the state machine

#### Key Features

**Singleton Pattern for Global Management**
```python
class BotManager:
    _instance = None  # Global bot coordination
    
    def register_game(self, room_id, game, state_machine):
        # Creates GameBotHandler for each game room
```

**Intelligent Action Deduplication**
```python
def _is_duplicate_action(self, bot_name, action_type, context):
    # Prevents duplicate bot actions using:
    # - Action hashing with context
    # - Time-based cache expiration
    # - Turn/phase sequence tracking
```

**Sequential Bot Processing**
- Declarations: 0.5-1.5s delay per bot for realism
- Plays: Same timing pattern as declarations
- Redeal decisions: Human-like decision timing

#### Event Flow Integration

The BotManager integrates with the enterprise state machine architecture:

1. **Phase Change Events**: Automatically triggers appropriate bot actions
2. **Enterprise Broadcasting**: All bot actions go through the state machine for automatic broadcasting
3. **Validation Feedback**: Handles action acceptance/rejection appropriately

### 4. State Machine Integration

The AI system integrates deeply with the game's enterprise state machine:

#### Declaration Phase (`backend/engine/state_machine/states/declaration_state.py`)
- Manages declaration order and validation
- Triggers bot declarations through BotManager
- Enforces game rules (sum ≠ 8, streak limits)

#### Turn Phase (`backend/engine/state_machine/states/turn_state.py`) 
- Handles piece play validation and sequencing
- Manages turn resolution and winner determination
- Coordinates bot play timing and order

#### Enterprise Architecture Benefits
1. **Automatic Broadcasting**: All AI actions trigger automatic UI updates
2. **State Consistency**: Single source of truth for all game state
3. **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all AI decisions
4. **JSON Serialization**: Seamless WebSocket transmission

### 5. Game Rules Integration (`backend/engine/rules.py`)

The AI system leverages the game's rule engine to:

#### Validate Piece Combinations
```python
PLAY_TYPE_PRIORITY = [
    "SINGLE", "PAIR", "THREE_OF_A_KIND", "STRAIGHT",
    "FOUR_OF_A_KIND", "EXTENDED_STRAIGHT", "EXTENDED_STRAIGHT_5", 
    "FIVE_OF_A_KIND", "DOUBLE_STRAIGHT"
]

def get_play_type(pieces):
    # Determines if piece combination is valid
    # Returns play type or "INVALID"
```

#### Strategic Combo Discovery
The AI uses `find_all_valid_combos()` to discover all possible plays from 1-6 pieces, then filters based on viability.

### 6. Performance and Testing

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Decision Time**: < 50ms per declaration (target: < 100ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead with decision caching
- **Concurrency**: Multiple bot decisions can run in parallel
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple game rooms simultaneously

#### Comprehensive Testing
- **18 Strategic Examples**: All scenarios from documentation pass 100%
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Pile room 0, last player constraints, empty hands
- **Integration Tests**: Full game simulation with bots
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Decision timing validation

## AI Decision Examples

### Example 1: Context-Aware Declaration

**Scenario**: Strong hand as non-starter in strong field
```python
Hand: [ADVISOR_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Context: Position 2, Previous: [5, 4], Field: "strong"
Analysis:
- Pile room: 8 - (5+4) = -1 → 0 (no room!)
- Strong combos: STRAIGHT (CHARIOT-HORSE-CANNON)  
- Viable combos: None (no pile room)
- Openers: ADVISOR_RED (reliability 0.7 in strong field)
Result: Declares 0 (can't play anything due to pile room constraint)
```

### Example 2: GENERAL_RED Game Changer

**Scenario**: GENERAL_RED in weak field enables combo play
```python
Hand: [GENERAL_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK×4, CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_RED, CANNON_RED]
Context: Position 2, Previous: [1, 0], Field: "weak"  
Analysis:
- Has GENERAL_RED + weak field = acts like starter
- Strong combos: FOUR_OF_A_KIND (soldiers), STRAIGHT (chariot-horse-cannon)
- Both combos viable due to GENERAL_RED advantage
- Pile room: 8 - (1+0) = 7 (plenty of room)
Result: Declares 5 (strategic focus on FOUR_OF_A_KIND with GENERAL_RED)
```

## Integration Points
