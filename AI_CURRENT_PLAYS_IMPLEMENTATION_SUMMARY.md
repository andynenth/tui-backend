# AI Current Plays Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the integration of `game.current_turn_plays` data into the AI decision-making system, enabling the responder strategy to see and analyze plays made earlier in the current turn.

## What Was Done

### 1. Investigation & Testing
- Created `test_current_plays_data.py` to verify the structure and content of `game.current_turn_plays`
- Confirmed that TurnPlay objects contain: player, pieces, is_valid
- Verified data persists during turn and is cleared after

### 2. Bot Manager Integration
- Added import for `get_play_type` from rules module
- Replaced empty `current_plays=[]` with actual data:
  ```python
  current_plays=[
      {
          'player': play.player,
          'pieces': play.pieces,
          'play_type': get_play_type(play.pieces) if play.is_valid else None
      }
      for play in getattr(game_state, 'current_turn_plays', [])
  ],
  ```

### 3. Verification Testing
- Created `test_responder_with_real_data.py` to verify integration
- Tested multiple scenarios:
  - Responder sees current plays and makes decisions
  - Empty current_plays handled correctly
  - Invalid plays don't break the system

## Key Benefits

1. **Responder Strategy Now Works**: AI can see what others played and decide whether to beat them
2. **Strategic Decisions**: Based on urgency level, AI decides whether to try to win the turn
3. **Real Game Data**: No mock data - uses actual game state
4. **Graceful Handling**: Works with empty plays and invalid plays

## Example Behavior

When Bot2 is responding with low urgency:
- Sees: Human1 played PAIR (12 pts), Bot1 played SINGLE (11 pts)
- Current winner: Human1's PAIR
- Decision: With low urgency, plays weak CANNON pair (6 pts) to conserve strong pieces
- Result: Strategic play based on game context

## Technical Details

- Data source: `game.current_turn_plays` (List of TurnPlay objects)
- Data flow: Game → bot_manager → TurnPlayContext → AI strategy
- Format conversion: TurnPlay → dict with player, pieces, play_type
- No new data structures needed - leveraged existing game state

## Next Steps

The `revealed_pieces` tracking (all face-up pieces across the round) remains to be implemented. This would require:
- Adding accumulation of played pieces across turns
- Storing in game or state machine
- Passing to AI context

However, the current implementation already provides significant value by enabling proper responder strategy.
