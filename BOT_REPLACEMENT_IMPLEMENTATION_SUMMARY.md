# Bot Replacement Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the bot replacement feature that automatically activates bots when players disconnect and allows seamless reconnection.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Components

1. **ConnectionManager** (`/backend/api/websocket/connection_manager.py`)
   - Tracks WebSocket connections with UUID identification
   - Manages player connection states (connected/disconnected/reconnecting)
   - Handles reconnection detection
   - No grace period - players can reconnect anytime

2. **MessageQueueManager** (`/backend/api/websocket/message_queue.py`)
   - Queues critical game events for disconnected players
   - Maintains message sequence numbers
   - Delivers queued messages upon reconnection
   - Critical events: phase_change, turn_resolved, round_complete, etc.

3. **Player Model Updates** (`/backend/engine/player.py`)
   - Added connection tracking fields:
     - `is_connected`: Current connection status
     - `disconnect_time`: When player disconnected
     - `original_is_bot`: Store original bot state for reconnection

4. **Room Management Updates** (`/backend/engine/room.py`)
   - Added `is_host()` method to check if player is host
   - Added `migrate_host()` method for host migration
   - Priority: connected human → any human → any bot

5. **WebSocket Handler Updates** (`/backend/api/routes/ws.py`)
   - WebSocket UUID tracking for player identification
   - `broadcast_with_queue()` function for disconnected player handling
   - Comprehensive `handle_disconnect()` function
   - Player registration on join_room and client_ready
   - Reconnection detection and queued message delivery

6. **Bot Manager Updates** (`/backend/engine/bot_manager.py`)
   - Added `player_bot_activated` event handler
   - Bot immediately takes action if it's their turn
   - Handles all game phases: preparation, declaration, turn

### Frontend Components

1. **Type Definitions** (`/frontend/src/services/types.ts`)
   - Updated Player interface with connection tracking
   - Added disconnectedPlayers and host to GameState
   - Added playerName to ConnectionData
   - Added new event types for bot replacement

2. **GameService Updates** (`/frontend/src/services/GameService.ts`)
   - Added event handlers for player disconnect/reconnect
   - Host change handling
   - Queued message processing
   - Preserves connection status when updating players

3. **NetworkService Updates** (`/frontend/src/services/NetworkService.ts`)
   - Sends player name in client_ready event for reconnection

## How It Works

### Disconnection Flow
1. WebSocket disconnects (browser close, network issue)
2. ConnectionManager marks player as disconnected
3. Player's is_bot flag set to true, is_connected set to false
4. Messages for player are queued instead of sent
5. Bot manager notified if it's the player's turn
6. Host migration triggered if disconnected player was host

### Reconnection Flow
1. Player connects with same name to same room
2. System detects previous disconnect state
3. Player restored: is_bot = original_is_bot, is_connected = true
4. All queued messages delivered in order
5. Message queue cleared
6. Player resumes control from bot

### Host Migration
1. When host disconnects, system finds new host
2. Priority order:
   - First connected human player
   - First human player (even if disconnected)
   - First bot if no humans
3. All players notified of host change

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `/backend/tests/test_bot_replacement.py`
- Tests connection management, message queueing, host migration
- All tests passing

## Key Features
- ✅ Automatic bot takeover on disconnect
- ✅ Seamless reconnection with state preservation
- ✅ Message queueing for disconnected players
- ✅ Host migration on host disconnect
- ✅ No grace period - instant bot activation
- ✅ Works in all game phases
- ✅ Frontend shows disconnection status
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Usage
The feature works automatically - no configuration needed:
1. When a player disconnects, their avatar shows as "BOT"
2. The bot plays conservatively to keep the game moving
3. When the player reconnects, they regain control
4. All game events that occurred while disconnected are delivered

## Future Enhancements
- Visual indicators for disconnected players in UI
- Configurable grace period before bot activation
- Bot difficulty settings
- Reconnection notifications to other players
