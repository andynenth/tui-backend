# Documentation Management Plan for Code Quality Tracking

1 Create a Code Quality Tracking System

⠀A. Quality Review Log (QUALITY_REVIEW_LOG.md)
Create a markdown file to track all reviews:

# Code Quality Review Log

## Review Sessions

### 2025-01-13 - Sprint 1 Review

- **Reviewer(s)**: [Names]
- **Files Reviewed**: 15 components
- **Issues Found**: 45
- **Issues Fixed**: 32
- **Follow-ups Created**: 13

⠀B. Component Review Status (frontend/REVIEW_STATUS.md)
Track individual file review status:

# Component Review Status

## Components

| **File**          | **Last Reviewed** | **Reviewer** | **Status** | **Issues** | **Notes**       |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| TurnContent.jsx   | 2025-01-13        | John         | ✅ Pass    | 0          | Well-documented |
| GameService.ts    | -                 | -            | ❌ Pending | -          | Needs tests     |
| NetworkService.ts | 2025-01-12        | Jane         | ⚠️ Issues  | 5          | See ticket #123 |

2 Implement a Ticketing System

⠀A. GitHub Issues Template
Create issue templates for quality improvements:

- quality-issue.md - For tracking quality problems
- quality-improvement.md - For enhancement suggestions
- technical-debt.md - For refactoring needs

⠀B. Issue Labels

- quality:critical - Must fix immediately
- quality:important - Fix within sprint
- quality:nice-to-have - When time permits
- quality:reviewed - Has been reviewed
- quality:in-progress - Being worked on
  3 Weekly Quality Reports

⠀A. Automated Metrics Dashboard (QUALITY_METRICS.md)

6 Tracking Tools

⠀A. VS Code Extensions

- Todo Tree - Track TODO/FIXME comments
- Better Comments - Highlight quality notes
- GitLens - Track who reviewed what

⠀B. Scripts for Automation

# scripts/quality-report.sh

#!/bin/bashecho "## Quality Report - $(date)"echo "### ESLint Issues"npm run lint 2>&1 | grep -E "error|warning" | wc -lecho "### Test Coverage"npm run test:coverage -- --json --outputFile=coverage.jsonecho "### TODOs"grep -r "TODO|FIXME" --exclude-dir=node_modules . | wc -l
7 Review Process

⠀A. Daily

- Check pre-commit hooks are passing
- Update personal review progress

⠀B. Weekly

- Team review of QUALITY_METRICS.md
- Update QUALITY_REVIEW_LOG.md
- Plan next week's quality goals

⠀C. Sprint

- Review resolution tracking table
- Update CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md
- Celebrate improvements
  8 Knowledge Sharing

⠀A. Quality Champions

- Assign rotating "Quality Champion" each sprint
- Responsible for running weekly metrics
- Leads quality discussions in retrospectives

⠀B. Documentation Standards

- Every complex function needs a "why" comment
- Every component needs usage examples
- Every API endpoint needs request/response examples

⠀This approach ensures systematic tracking, clear ownership, and measurable progress while keeping documentation overhead manageable.
