# Integration Progress Log

## EventStore and Async Architecture Activation

### Overview
This document tracks the step-by-step integration of EventStore (State Sync/Replay) and Async Architecture features that were found to be implemented but disconnected from the execution path.

---

## Part 1: EventStore (State Sync/Replay) Activation

### Step 1: Add EventStore to base_state.py ✅ Completed
- **File**: `backend/engine/state_machine/base_state.py`
- **Method**: `update_phase_data()`
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**: Added event_store.store_event() call after broadcast
- **Test Result**: Ready for testing

### Step 2: Mount Debug Routes ✅ Completed
- **File**: `backend/api/routes/routes.py`  
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `from . import debug` import
  - Added `router.include_router(debug.router)`
- **Test Result**: Ready for testing

### Step 3: Test EventStore Recording ✅ Completed
- **Status**: Completed
- **Test Result**: 
  - ✅ Debug routes successfully mounted and accessible
  - ✅ Events are being stored (found 9 events for TEST123 room)
  - ✅ EventStore stats show 251 total events, sequence 375
  - ✅ Event types include: phase_data_update, phase_change

### Step 4: Verify Replay Functionality ✅ Completed
- **Status**: Completed
- **Test Result**: 
  - ✅ Replay endpoint accessible at /api/debug/replay/{room_id}
  - ✅ Successfully reconstructed state from 9 events
  - ✅ State shows correct phase, round number, and event count

- **Status**: Not started
- **Test Result**: Pending

### Step 2: Update WebSocket Handlers ⏳ Pending
- **File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`
- **Status**: Not started
- **Test Result**: Pending

### Step 3: Test Full Async Flow ⏳ Pending
- **Status**: Not started
- **Test Result**: Pending
