# Integration Progress Log

## EventStore and Async Architecture Activation

### Overview
This document tracks the step-by-step integration of EventStore (State Sync/Replay) and Async Architecture features that were found to be implemented but disconnected from the execution path.

---

## Part 1: EventStore (State Sync/Replay) Activation

### Step 1: Add EventStore to base_state.py ✅ Completed
- **File**: `backend/engine/state_machine/base_state.py`
- **Method**: `update_phase_data()`
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**: Added event_store.store_event() call after broadcast
- **Test Result**: Ready for testing

### Step 2: Mount Debug Routes ✅ Completed
- **File**: `backend/api/routes/routes.py`  
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `from . import debug` import
  - Added `router.include_router(debug.router)`
- **Test Result**: Ready for testing

### Step 3: Test EventStore Recording ✅ Completed
- **Status**: Completed
- **Test Result**: 
  - ✅ Debug routes successfully mounted and accessible
  - ✅ Events are being stored (found 9 events for TEST123 room)
  - ✅ EventStore stats show 251 total events, sequence 375
  - ✅ Event types include: phase_data_update, phase_change

### Step 4: Verify Replay Functionality ✅ Completed
- **Status**: Completed
- **Test Result**: 
  - ✅ Replay endpoint accessible at /api/debug/replay/{room_id}
  - ✅ Successfully reconstructed state from 9 events
  - ✅ State shows correct phase, round number, and event count

## Part 2: Async Architecture Activation

### Step 1: Switch to AsyncRoomManager ❌ Failed
- **File**: `backend/shared_instances.py`
- **Status**: Attempted but reverted
- **Issue**: Import path conflicts between `engine.` and `backend.engine.`
- **Test Result**: Server failed to start due to module import errors
- **Notes**: AsyncRoomManager exists but needs proper integration setup

### Step 2: Update WebSocket Handlers ❌ Failed  
- **File**: `backend/api/routes/ws.py`
- **Status**: Attempted but reverted
- **Changes Made**: Added `await` to room_manager method calls
- **Issue**: Dependent on AsyncRoomManager working first
- **Test Result**: Changes were reverted with Step 1

### Step 3: Test Full Async Flow ⏳ Not Started
- **Status**: Blocked by Step 1 and 2
- **Test Result**: N/A

## Summary

### EventStore Integration: ✅ SUCCESS
- Successfully added event storage to phase changes in `base_state.py`
- Mounted debug routes successfully
- Verified events are being stored (251 total events in test)
- Replay functionality confirmed working
- All debug endpoints accessible: `/api/debug/events/{room_id}`, `/api/debug/replay/{room_id}`

### Async Architecture Integration: ❌ BLOCKED
- AsyncRoomManager implementation exists but has import path issues
- The async classes (AsyncRoom, AsyncGame) are implemented
- WebSocket handlers need to be updated to use await
- **Root Cause**: Module import paths need to be fixed for async classes
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Fix import paths in async modules
  2. Update shared_instances.py to use AsyncRoomManager
  3. Add await to all room_manager calls in ws.py

## Testing Notes
- Each step will be tested individually before proceeding
- Diffs will be generated after each code change
- Errors and fixes will be documented here
