# ====================
echo "üêõ [1/8] Training Core Bug Fix Patterns..."

# Off-by-One Error Pattern
npx claude-flow@alpha training pattern-learn --operation "bug-fix: off-by-one slot conversion - frontend sends 1-based IDs, backend needs 0-based. Fixed: slot_index = request.slot_id - 1 not -2" --outcome "success"
show_progress "Off-by-One Error Pattern"
((current++))

# Dense vs Sparse Array Pattern
npx claude-flow@alpha training pattern-learn --operation "bug-fix: dense vs sparse array - WebSocket must send 4-element arrays with null for empty slots. Fixed: players_array = [None] * 4" --outcome "success"

# ====================
# 2. DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY PATTERNS
# ====================
echo "üîç [2/8] Training Debugging Methodology Patterns..."

# Systematic Investigation Pattern
npx claude-flow@alpha training pattern-learn --operation "debugging: multiplayer slot bugs - use Playwright with 2 contexts, log states, trace WebSocket, validate with same sequence" --outcome "success"
show_progress "Systematic Investigation Pattern"
((current++))

# Test-First Investigation
npx claude-flow@alpha training pattern-learn --operation "debugging: investigate before fix - follow exact test sequence, document observations, find root cause before implementing" --outcome "success"

# ====================
echo "üêù [4/8] Training Team Coordination Patterns..."

# Hive Mind Debugging
npx claude-flow@alpha training pattern-learn --operation "team-coordination: complex debugging - use specialized agents: Playwright tester, WebSocket analyzer, pattern expert, fixer, validator" --outcome "success"

# Fix Verification Protocol
