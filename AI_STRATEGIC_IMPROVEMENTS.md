## Detailed Strategic Improvements

### SI-001: Information Asymmetry Risk Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `field_weak_01` test scenario expects 3 piles but should expect 0 due to information asymmetry considerations.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_weak_01
Hand: [ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_RED, CANNON_BLACK]
Position: 2 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [0, 0]
Current expected: 3 ❌
Correct expected: 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- Players 1 & 2 declared [0, 0] = very weak hands
- AI sees "weak field" and thinks medium pieces (9-10 points) become viable
- Declares 3 expecting to win with ELEPHANT pieces against weak opponents

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **No Control Mechanism**: No opener (highest piece is ELEPHANT at 9-10 points), no combos available
2. **Information Asymmetry Risk**: When P1&P2 are extremely weak ([0,0]), P4 becomes statistically more likely to have concentrated strength
3. **Unknown Player 4 Threat**: P4 could have GENERAL_RED as opener + strong combos (FOUR_OF_A_KIND, FIVE_OF_A_KIND)
4. **Medium Pieces Vulnerability**: ELEPHANT pieces (9-10 points) cannot compete against potential GENERAL_RED (14 points) or strong combos
5. **Game Theory Insight**: In information asymmetry scenarios, conservative play protects against unknown concentrated threats

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: P1 & P2 declare very low (0-1) AND Player has no opener/combos
Risk: Unknown P4 could have monster hand (GENERAL_RED + combos)  
Response: Conservative declaration (0-1) protects against asymmetric threat
Principle: "Better to under-declare than lose catastrophically to unknown strength"
```

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Enhanced Field Assessment Logic**:
   - Add information asymmetry detection
   - Weight unknown player threat probability
   - Factor in hand control mechanisms (openers/combos)

2. **Risk Assessment Framework**:
   - Calculate concentrated threat probability
   - Assess player's defensive capabilities
   - Implement conservative bias for high-risk scenarios

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 3 → 0
   - Update description: "Information Asymmetry Risk Assessment"  
   - Update strategic focus: "Unknown Player 4 threat when P1&P2 are weak"
   - Increase difficulty: BASIC → ADVANCED

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Addresses fundamental gap in strategic reasoning

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly identifies information asymmetry scenarios
- Conservative declarations in high-risk unknown player situations
- Maintains appropriate aggression when control mechanisms exist

### SI-002: Opener vs Junk Hand Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `field_weak_02` test scenario expects 2 piles but should expect 1 due to opener-only hand composition.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_weak_02
Hand: [ADVISOR_RED, CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Position: 1 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [1]
Current expected: 2 ❌
Correct expected: 1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees ADVISOR_RED (12 points) as reliable opener in weak field
- AI overestimates additional winning potential from remaining pieces
- Declares 2 expecting opener + one additional pile

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **Single Reliable Opener**: ADVISOR_RED (12 points) is indeed reliable in weak field
2. **Junk Supporting Cast**: Remaining pieces are all low-value (6-8 points)
   - CHARIOT_RED (8), HORSE_BLACK (6), CANNON_BLACK (7)
   - Multiple SOLDIER pieces (1 point each)
3. **No Additional Win Conditions**: After using ADVISOR_RED, no other pieces competitive
4. **Realistic Assessment**: One reliable opener = one pile declaration

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: Reliable opener (11+ points) + Weak supporting pieces (≤8 points)
Assessment: Opener provides exactly 1 pile, supporting pieces unlikely to win additional
Response: Conservative declaration matching realistic winning potential
Principle: "Don't overestimate junk pieces even in weak fields"
```

**Hand Composition Analysis**:
- **Tier 1 (Reliable)**: ADVISOR_RED (12) - 1 pile
- **Tier 2 (Marginal)**: CHARIOT_RED (8) - unreliable even in weak field  
- **Tier 3 (Junk)**: HORSE_BLACK (6), CANNON_BLACK (7), SOLDIERs (1) - no winning potential

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Hand Composition Evaluation**:
   - Separate reliable pieces from marginal/junk pieces
   - Don't double-count weak field bonuses
   - Realistic assessment of secondary piece viability

2. **Opener Assessment Refinement**:
   - Opener reliability doesn't boost junk pieces
   - Single opener = single pile expectation
   - Weak field helps opener but doesn't transform junk

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 2 → 1
   - Update strategic focus: "Single opener with junk supporting cast"
   - Update notes: "ADVISOR reliable, but remaining pieces (6-8 pts) won't win additional piles"

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Addresses opener assessment accuracy

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly evaluates single-opener hands
- Doesn't overestimate junk pieces in any field strength
- Maintains accuracy for multi-opener scenarios

---

### SI-003: Information Asymmetry Risk (Combo Variant)

**Issue Identified**: `field_weak_03` test scenario expects 2 piles but should expect 0 due to information asymmetry risk with weak combo hand.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_weak_03
Hand: [CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_RED, CANNON_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Position: 3 (last player, not starter)
Previous declarations: [0, 1, 0]
Current expected: 2 ❌
Correct expected: 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees STRAIGHT (CHARIOT-HORSE-CANNON RED) totaling 18 points
- AI thinks "weak field enables weak combos" 
- Declares 2 expecting 18-point straight might work in very weak field

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **No Control Mechanism**: No opener (highest single is ELEPHANT_BLACK at 9 points)
2. **Weak Combo Quality**: 18-point STRAIGHT is fundamentally weak
3. **Information Asymmetry Pattern**: Players declared [0, 1, 0] = 2 out of 3 known players are extremely weak
4. **Unknown Player 4 Threat**: Last unknown player could have concentrated strength
5. **Combo Vulnerability**: Weak combos need control to be played - without opener, can't guarantee opportunity

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: Weak combo (≤20 points) + No opener + Multiple weak known players ([0,1,0])
Risk: Unknown player could have strong opener + better combos
Response: Conservative declaration (0) protects against combo opportunity theft
Principle: "Weak combos are worthless without control, especially vs unknown strength"
```

**Combo Analysis**:
- **STRAIGHT RED**: CHARIOT (8) + HORSE (6) + CANNON (7) = 21 points total
- **Quality Assessment**: Borderline viable in normal field, weak in competitive field
- **Control Requirement**: Needs opener or starter position to guarantee play opportunity
- **Risk Factor**: Unknown Player 4 could have GENERAL + strong combos

**Key Difference from SI-001**:
- SI-001: Medium singles (ELEPHANTs 9-10) vs Information asymmetry
- SI-003: Weak combo (18-point STRAIGHT) vs Information asymmetry + control problem

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Enhanced Combo Viability Assessment**:
   - Factor in control mechanisms for combo playability
   - Weak combos (<21 points) require guaranteed opportunity
   - Information asymmetry increases control requirement threshold

2. **Information Asymmetry Detection**:
   - Multiple weak known players increases unknown player threat probability
   - [0,1,0] pattern = 2/3 known players weak → higher risk from unknown P4
   - Combo hands more vulnerable than single-piece hands to control theft

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 2 → 0
   - Update description: "Information Asymmetry + Combo Control Risk"
   - Update strategic focus: "Weak combo needs control, unknown P4 could steal opportunity"
   - Maintain difficulty: ADVANCED (correct complexity level)

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Same pattern as SI-001, combo variant

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly identifies combo control requirements in asymmetric scenarios
- Conservative combo assessment when multiple known players are weak
- Maintains appropriate combo evaluation when control mechanisms exist

### SI-004: Strong Opener vs Junk Hand Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `field_weak_04` test scenario expects 2 piles but should expect 1 due to single strong opener with junk supporting pieces.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_weak_04
Hand: [GENERAL_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_RED, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK]
Position: 2 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [0, 1]
Current expected: 2 ❌
Correct expected: 1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) as very strong opener in weak field
- AI overestimates additional winning potential from remaining pieces
- Declares 2 expecting strong opener + one additional pile from remaining pieces

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **Single Dominant Opener**: GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) is indeed extremely reliable in weak field
2. **Junk Supporting Cast**: Remaining pieces are all medium-to-low value (6-10 points)
   - Best remaining: ELEPHANT_RED (10), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9)
   - Medium pieces: CHARIOT_RED (8), CANNON_BLACK (7), HORSE_RED (6)
   - Junk: SOLDIER_RED (1), SOLDIER_BLACK (1)
3. **No Additional Reliable Winners**: Even ELEPHANT pieces (9-10) not guaranteed in competitive scenarios
4. **Same Pattern as SI-002**: One reliable opener = one pile declaration

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: Single strong opener (13+ points) + Medium/weak supporting pieces (≤10 points)
Assessment: Opener provides exactly 1 pile, supporting pieces unreliable even in weak field
Response: Conservative declaration matching realistic winning potential  
Principle: "Even stronger openers don't magically transform weak supporting pieces"
```

**Hand Composition Analysis**:
- **Tier 1 (Highly Reliable)**: GENERAL_BLACK (13) - 1 pile ✅
- **Tier 2 (Marginal)**: ELEPHANT_RED (10), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9) - unreliable
- **Tier 3 (Weak)**: CHARIOT_RED (8), CANNON_BLACK (7), HORSE_RED (6) - low win probability
- **Tier 4 (Junk)**: SOLDIER_RED (1), SOLDIER_BLACK (1) - no winning potential

**Key Difference from SI-002**:
- **SI-002**: ADVISOR_RED (12 points) + junk pieces (6-8 points)
- **SI-004**: GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) + medium pieces (6-10 points)
- **Same Principle**: Single opener doesn't boost weak supporting cast

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Opener Strength Calibration**:
   - GENERAL (13-14 points) extremely reliable but still only provides 1 pile
   - Strong opener reliability doesn't transfer to supporting pieces
   - Avoid "halo effect" where strong opener inflates weak piece assessments

2. **Supporting Piece Evaluation**:
   - ELEPHANT pieces (9-10) marginal even in weak fields
   - Medium pieces (6-8) still unreliable regardless of opener strength
   - Conservative assessment of non-opener pieces

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 2 → 1
   - Update strategic focus: "Single strong opener with medium/weak supporting cast"
   - Update notes: "GENERAL dominates but remaining pieces (6-10 pts) won't win additional piles"

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Same pattern as SI-002, stronger opener variant

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly evaluates single strong opener hands
- Doesn't overestimate medium pieces even with very strong openers
- Maintains accuracy across different opener strength levels (ADVISOR vs GENERAL)

### SI-005: Medium Pieces Overestimation in Weak Fields

**Issue Identified**: `field_weak_05` test scenario expects 3 piles but should expect 0-1 due to overestimation of medium pieces without control.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_weak_05
Hand: [SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_RED, ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK]
Position: 1 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [0]
Current expected: 3 ❌
Correct expected: 0-1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees multiple medium pieces (6-10 points) in weak field
- AI thinks "multiple medium pieces can win vs weak opponents"
- Declares 3 expecting ELEPHANT_RED (10) + ELEPHANT_BLACK (9) + CHARIOT_RED (8) to all win

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **No Control Mechanism**: No opener (highest is ELEPHANT_RED at 10 points - not reliable opener)
2. **Medium Pieces Limitations**: While better than junk, medium pieces (6-10) still unreliable
3. **Competition Among Medium Pieces**: Can't play all medium pieces - opponents will have some medium pieces too
4. **Realistic Assessment**: Maybe 1 piece (likely ELEPHANT_RED) could win one turn, but not 3

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: Multiple medium pieces (6-10 points) + No opener + Weak field
Assessment: Maybe 1 piece can win opportunistically, but not multiple guaranteed wins
Response: Conservative declaration (0-1) matching realistic single-piece potential
Principle: "Medium pieces can grab opportunities but can't dominate without control"
```

**Hand Composition Analysis**:
- **Tier 1 (Marginal)**: ELEPHANT_RED (10) - might win 1 turn in weak field
- **Tier 2 (Weak)**: ELEPHANT_BLACK (9), CHARIOT_RED (8), CANNON_RED (7), HORSE_BLACK (6)
- **Tier 3 (Junk)**: SOLDIER_RED (1), SOLDIER_RED (1), SOLDIER_BLACK (1)

**Key Insights**:
- **Not Information Asymmetry**: Only 1 previous declaration [0], so P3&P4 are unknown (different from SI-001/SI-003)
- **Medium Piece Reality Check**: 6-10 point pieces can grab opportunities but can't reliably dominate
- **Control vs Opportunity**: Without opener/starter, relying on opportunistic wins (1 max)

**Strategic Distinction**:
- **SI-001/SI-003**: Information asymmetry creates unknown threat → Conservative 0
- **SI-005**: Medium pieces without control → Realistic 0-1 (maybe grab one opportunity)

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Medium Piece Calibration**:
   - ELEPHANT pieces (9-10) marginal even in weak fields
   - Multiple medium pieces don't multiply win probability
   - Without control, opportunistic wins limited to 1-2 max

2. **Weak Field Assessment Refinement**:
   - Weak field enables opportunities but doesn't guarantee dominance
   - Medium pieces benefit from weak field but still compete with each other
   - Conservative estimation of multiple medium piece scenarios

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 3 → 1 (conservative but realistic)
   - Update description: "Medium Pieces Opportunistic Assessment"
   - Update strategic focus: "Medium pieces might grab 1 opportunity in weak field"
   - Update notes: "ELEPHANT_RED might win 1 turn, but multiple medium pieces don't multiply success"

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Addresses medium piece assessment accuracy

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly evaluates multiple medium piece hands
- Realistic assessment of opportunistic winning potential
- Doesn't overestimate cumulative medium piece strength

### SI-006: Normal Field Opener Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `field_mixed_02` test scenario expects 2 piles but should expect 0-1 due to overestimation of medium pieces in normal field conditions.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_mixed_02
Hand: [GENERAL_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_RED, ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK]
Position: 1 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [2]
Current expected: 2 ❌
Correct expected: 0-1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) as reliable opener in normal field
- AI assumes ELEPHANT pieces (9-10 points) will win additional pile in normal field
- Declares 2 expecting opener + one ELEPHANT to win

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **Strong Opener Reliable**: GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) is indeed reliable in normal field
2. **Normal Field Constraint**: Previous [2] = normal field strength, not weak
3. **ELEPHANT Limitations**: In normal field, ELEPHANT pieces (9-10) are marginal at best
4. **Conservative Assessment**: Strong opener provides 1 pile, ELEPHANTs might capture 0-1 additional

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: Strong opener (13+ points) + Medium pieces (9-10) + Normal field ([2])
Assessment: Opener reliable (1 pile), medium pieces marginal (0-1 additional)  
Response: Conservative declaration (1) with possible upside to 2
Principle: "Normal fields make medium pieces unreliable, even with strong opener"
```

**Hand Composition Analysis**:
- **Tier 1 (Reliable)**: GENERAL_BLACK (13) - 1 pile ✅
- **Tier 2 (Marginal)**: ELEPHANT_RED (10), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9) - 0-1 pile combined
- **Tier 3 (Weak)**: CHARIOT_BLACK (8), CANNON_RED (7), HORSE_BLACK (6) - low probability
- **Tier 4 (Junk)**: SOLDIER_RED (1), SOLDIER_RED (1) - no winning potential

**Field Strength Context**:
- **Previous [2]**: Borderline normal field (not weak, not strong)
- **Normal Field Impact**: ELEPHANTs (9-10) become unreliable vs competent opponents
- **Different from Weak Field**: In weak fields, ELEPHANTs might be more viable

**Key Distinction from Previous Cases**:
- **SI-002/SI-004**: Weak field scenarios where supporting pieces were junk
- **SI-006**: Normal field where supporting pieces are medium but still unreliable

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Field Strength Calibration**:
   - Normal field ([2] declaration) reduces medium piece reliability
   - ELEPHANT pieces (9-10) marginal in normal competitive environment
   - Strong opener doesn't boost medium piece viability in normal fields

2. **Medium Piece Assessment in Normal Fields**:
   - 9-10 point pieces unreliable vs normal opponents
   - Conservative estimation for non-opener pieces
   - Avoid double-counting opener strength and field effects

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 2 → 1 (conservative realistic assessment)
   - Update description: "Strong Opener in Normal Field"
   - Update strategic focus: "GENERAL reliable, ELEPHANTs marginal in normal field"
   - Update notes: "Previous [2] = normal field, ELEPHANTs (9-10 pts) unreliable vs competent opponents"

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Addresses opener + medium piece interaction in normal fields

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly calibrates medium piece reliability based on field strength
- Strong opener assessment doesn't inflate medium piece expectations
- Appropriate conservative bias for normal field conditions

---

### SI-007: No Opener Medium Pieces Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `field_mixed_03` test scenario expects 1 pile but should expect 0 due to overestimation of medium pieces without any opener in normal field.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_mixed_03
Hand: [CHARIOT_RED, HORSE_RED, CANNON_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, SOLDIER_BLACK, ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_BLACK]
Position: 3 (last player, not starter)
Previous declarations: [2, 2, 2]
Current expected: 1 ❌
Correct expected: 0 ✅ (leaning toward 0, though 0-1 possible)
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees ELEPHANT pieces (9-10 points) as potential winners
- AI assumes one ELEPHANT could capture a pile in normal field
- Declares 1 expecting ELEPHANT_RED or ELEPHANT_BLACK to win opportunistically

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning
1. **No Control Mechanism**: No opener (highest single is ELEPHANT_RED at 10 points - not reliable)
2. **Normal Field Strength**: Previous [2,2,2] = consistent normal field, competent opponents
3. **ELEPHANT Unreliability**: 9-10 point pieces unreliable vs normal opponents without control
4. **Conservative Reality**: Medium pieces without opener are very unlikely to win vs competent field

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
```
When: No opener + Medium pieces (9-10) + Consistent normal field ([2,2,2])
Assessment: Medium pieces unreliable without control vs competent opponents
Response: Conservative declaration (0) - minimal winning probability
Principle: "Medium pieces need control or weak opponents to be viable"
```

**Hand Composition Analysis**:
- **Tier 1 (Marginal)**: ELEPHANT_RED (10) - unreliable without control
- **Tier 2 (Weak)**: ELEPHANT_BLACK (9), CHARIOT_RED (8), CHARIOT_BLACK (8), CANNON_RED (7), HORSE_RED (6)
- **Tier 3 (Junk)**: SOLDIER_BLACK (1), SOLDIER_BLACK (1)

**Field Context Analysis**:
- **Previous [2,2,2]**: All opponents declared 2 = consistent normal field strength
- **Competent Opposition**: Unlike weak fields, normal opponents will have competitive pieces
- **No Information Asymmetry**: All players known to be competent (unlike SI-001/SI-003)

**Key Strategic Insights**:
- **Different from SI-005**: SI-005 had weak field ([0]), SI-007 has normal field ([2,2,2])
- **Different from SI-006**: SI-006 had strong opener, SI-007 has no opener
- **Core Issue**: Medium pieces (9-10) unreliable in normal competitive environment without control

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Control Mechanism Assessment**:
   - Without opener (11+ points), medium pieces become very unreliable
   - Normal field opponents will have competitive pieces (8-12 points)
   - Conservative bias for no-control scenarios in normal fields

2. **Field Strength Calibration**:
   - [2,2,2] = consistent normal field = competent opposition
   - Medium pieces (9-10) insufficient vs normal competition
   - Avoid overestimating opportunistic potential without control

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Change expected value: 1 → 0 (conservative realistic assessment)
   - Update description: "No Opener Medium Pieces in Normal Field"
   - Update strategic focus: "ELEPHANTs unreliable without control vs competent opponents"
   - Update notes: "Previous [2,2,2] = normal field, ELEPHANTs need control or weak opponents to win"

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Addresses no-opener medium piece assessment in normal fields

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly identifies lack of control mechanisms
- Conservative assessment of medium pieces in normal fields without openers
- Proper distinction between weak field opportunities and normal field competition

### SI-008: Forfeit Strategy in Extreme Mixed Fields

**Issue Identified**: `field_mixed_04` test scenario expects 1 pile but should expect 0 due to forfeit strategy considerations in extreme mixed field.

**Current Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: field_mixed_04
Hand: [ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_RED, CANNON_BLACK]
Position: 2 (not starter)
Previous declarations: [0, 4]
Current expected: 1 ❌
Correct expected: 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### Current Flawed Logic
- AI sees extreme mixed field [0, 4] and gets confused about strategy
- AI assumes ELEPHANT pieces (9-10 points) might win against weak P1
- Declares 1 expecting to opportunistically beat the weak player

#### Correct Strategic Reasoning - Forfeit Strategy
1. **Extreme Field Imbalance**: P1 declared 0 (very weak), P2 declared 4 (very strong)
2. **Strong Player Dominance**: P2 (declared 4) will likely control most turns
3. **Forfeit Strategy Opportunity**: Declare 0 and use weak pieces as forfeits
4. **ELEPHANT Forfeit Value**: Use ELEPHANT_RED/BLACK as forfeit pieces to preserve better cards for future rounds

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition - Advanced Game Theory
```
When: Extreme mixed field (weak + very strong players) + Medium pieces only
Strategy: Forfeit current round to preserve card quality for future rounds
Response: Declare 0 and forfeit medium pieces strategically
Principle: "Sometimes losing efficiently is better than trying to win marginally"
```

**Forfeit Strategy Explanation**:
- **Concept**: Deliberately lose this round while minimizing long-term damage
- **Execution**: Use ELEPHANT pieces as forfeits (they're good enough to forfeit but not good enough to win)
- **Long-term Benefit**: Preserve better pieces for rounds where you have better winning chances
- **Risk Management**: Avoid competing against very strong player (P2) in unfavorable conditions

**Hand Analysis for Forfeiting**:
- **Forfeit Candidates**: ELEPHANT_RED (10), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9) - good enough to forfeit
- **Preserve**: CHARIOT pieces (8), HORSE pieces (6), CANNON pieces (7) - keep for better opportunities
- **Strategic Logic**: Use medium-high pieces as forfeits to avoid using low pieces later

**Field Context Analysis**:
- **[0, 4] Pattern**: Extreme imbalance - one very weak, one very strong player
- **P1 (declared 0)**: Will likely forfeit or play very weak pieces
- **P2 (declared 4)**: Will dominate most turns with strong pieces/combos
- **P4 (unknown)**: Could be anywhere on strength spectrum

**Advanced Strategic Considerations**:
1. **Turn Control**: P2 will likely control most turns, making competition difficult
2. **Opportunity Cost**: Fighting for marginal wins now vs preserving strength for better rounds
3. **Risk-Reward**: Low probability wins not worth the card quality cost
4. **Long-term Optimization**: Forfeit strategy optimizes across multiple rounds, not just current round

### SI-009: Combo Control + Forfeit Strategy Pattern (VALIDATED)

**Issue Status**: **ALREADY CORRECT** - Test scenarios properly expect 0, validating strategic framework

**Validated Scenarios**:
```
combo_viable_02: Hand with great combos, no control, expects 0 ✅
combo_viable_05: Strong combo vs weak field, no opportunity, expects 0 ✅  
combo_viable_06: Excellent combo vs strong opponent control, expects 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Pattern Validation**:

This validates the strategic framework we've been developing:

#### **combo_viable_02**: Great Combos + No Control = 0
- **Hand**: THREE_OF_A_KIND + STRAIGHT combos available
- **Position**: Non-starter, no opener
- **Field**: [2, 3] = competent opponents  
- **Forfeit Strategy**: Use ELEPHANT pieces as forfeits rather than fight for marginal wins
- **Correct Assessment**: 0 piles ✅

#### **combo_viable_05**: Strong Combo + No Opportunity = 0  
- **Hand**: 21-point STRAIGHT (high quality)
- **Position**: Non-starter, no opener
- **Field**: [0, 1] = weak field but no opportunity creation
- **Strategic Reality**: Even strong combos need opportunity from opponents
- **Correct Assessment**: 0 piles ✅

#### **combo_viable_06**: Excellent Combo + Wrong Position = 0
- **Hand**: FOUR_OF_A_KIND (premium combo)
- **Position**: vs strong opponent [4] who will control
- **Forfeit Strategy**: Don't compete against strong control
- **Correct Assessment**: 0 piles ✅

**Key Strategic Insights VALIDATED**:

1. **Combo Control Requirement**: Even excellent combos need control or opportunity
2. **Forfeit Strategy**: Use medium pieces (ELEPHANTs) strategically as forfeits  
3. **Realistic Assessment**: Great hand ≠ guaranteed wins without position/control
4. **Field Dynamics**: Opponent strength patterns affect combo viability

**Implementation Validation**: 
These scenarios confirm our strategic framework is sound:
- Information asymmetry detection ✅
- Control mechanism requirements ✅  
- Forfeit strategy recognition ✅
- Realistic combo viability assessment ✅

**Technical Requirements**: 
The AI needs to implement the patterns we've identified:
- Combo opportunity detection based on opponent declarations
- Control mechanism assessment (starter, opener, field strength)
- Strategic forfeiting when competition is suboptimal
- Long-term card preservation thinking

### SI-010: Combo Identification Consistency

**Issue Identified**: `combo_quality_01` test scenario had inconsistent expected value compared to identical combo structure.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: combo_quality_01
Hand: [SOLDIER_RED×3, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Position: 0 (Starter)
Previous declarations: []
Expected: 3 → 6 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Combo Structure Comparison**:
- **combo_viable_01**: Same RED THREE_OF_A_KIND + BLACK STRAIGHT → Expected 6 ✅
- **combo_quality_01**: Same RED THREE_OF_A_KIND + BLACK STRAIGHT → Expected 3 ❌ → Corrected to 6 ✅

#### **Available Combos**:
1. **RED THREE_OF_A_KIND**: 3 SOLDIER_RED pieces → 3 piles
2. **BLACK STRAIGHT**: CHARIOT_BLACK + HORSE_BLACK + CANNON_BLACK → 3 piles
3. **Total**: 3 + 3 = 6 piles

#### **Strategic Justification**:
- **Identical Combo Structure**: Both scenarios have same combos available
- **Same Position**: Both are starter with guaranteed control
- **Same Strategic Context**: Can play both combos optimally
- **Consistency Requirement**: Identical hands should have identical expectations

#### **Risk Assessment**:
**Opponent Higher Straight Probability**: ~20-35%
- **Big RED Straight**: GENERAL_RED + ADVISOR_RED + ELEPHANT_RED (~3-9%)
- **Big BLACK Straight**: GENERAL_BLACK + ADVISOR_BLACK + ELEPHANT_BLACK (~6-12%) 
- **Small RED Straight**: CHARIOT_RED + HORSE_RED + CANNON_RED (~10-15%)

**Strategic Reality**: Even with moderate risk, starter position provides control advantage to play both combos before opponents can interfere.

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Combo Identification Consistency**:
   - Identical hand structures should produce identical assessments
   - Combo detection must be systematic and reproducible
   - Avoid arbitrary differences between similar scenarios

2. **Strategic Assessment Validation**:
   - Starter position advantage properly weighted
   - Risk assessment balanced with control mechanisms
   - Consistent application of combo viability rules

3. **Test Scenario Updates**:
   - Expected value: 3 → 6 ✅

### SI-011: Pair Rules Misunderstanding

**Issue Identified**: Test scenarios `combo_quality_03` and `combo_quality_04` incorrectly assumed different colored pieces could form pairs.

**Corrected Scenarios**:
```
combo_quality_03: Expected 2 → 0 ✅
combo_quality_04: Expected 0 → 0 ✅ (already correct value, wrong reasoning)
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **PAIR Rules from RULES.md**:
**PAIR**: "2 of the same `name` and `color`"

**Critical Rule**: Pairs require **SAME COLOR**, not just same name!

#### **combo_quality_03 Analysis**:
- **Hand**: `[ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, HORSE_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK]`
- **Previous Assessment**: "ELEPHANT pair (19pts) + CHARIOT pair (15pts)" ❌
- **Correct Assessment**: NO PAIRS POSSIBLE - all pieces are different colors
- **Available**: Only singles (ELEPHANT_RED vs ELEPHANT_BLACK = different pieces)
- **Expected**: 2 → 0 ✅

#### **combo_quality_04 Analysis**:  
- **Hand**: `[CANNON_RED, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, ELEPHANT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, ADVISOR_BLACK]`
- **Previous Assessment**: "CANNON pair (12pts) + SOLDIER pair (2pts)" ❌
- **Correct Assessment**: NO PAIRS POSSIBLE - all pieces are different colors
- **Expected**: Already 0 ✅ (correct value, wrong reasoning)

#### **Fundamental Rule Clarification**:
```
✅ Valid PAIR: ELEPHANT_RED + ELEPHANT_RED (same name + same color)
❌ Invalid PAIR: ELEPHANT_RED + ELEPHANT_BLACK (same name, different color)
```

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Pair Detection Logic**:
   - Must check both `name` AND `color` match
   - Different colored pieces of same name ≠ pair

### SI-012: Starter Privilege + Strategic Forfeiting

**Issue Identified**: `combo_quality_06` severely undervalued starter position and missed strategic forfeiting opportunities.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: combo_quality_06
Hand: [ADVISOR_RED, ADVISOR_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED×2, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK, ELEPHANT_BLACK]
Position: 0 (Starter)
Expected: 2 → 4 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Available Assets**:
1. **BLACK STRAIGHT**: CHARIOT_BLACK + HORSE_BLACK + CANNON_BLACK (3 piles) ✅
2. **RED SOLDIER PAIR**: SOLDIER_RED + SOLDIER_RED (2 piles) ✅  
3. **Strong Openers**: ADVISOR_RED (12 pts), ADVISOR_BLACK (11 pts)
4. **Medium Piece**: ELEPHANT_BLACK (9 pts)

#### **Strategic Options Analysis**:

**Option 1: Conservative Forfeit Strategy** → **3 piles**
- Play BLACK STRAIGHT (3 piles)
- Use SOLDIER_RED singles to strategically forfeit high-value pieces
- **Challenge**: Managing forfeit of 3 pieces (ADVISOR_RED, ADVISOR_BLACK, ELEPHANT_BLACK)

**Option 2: Optimal Balanced Strategy** → **4 piles** ✅
- Play BLACK STRAIGHT (3 piles) 
- Use ADVISOR_RED as opener (1 pile)
- **Strategic forfeiting**: ADVISOR_BLACK + ELEPHANT_BLACK
- **Advantage**: Only 2 pieces to forfeit, manageable complexity

**Option 3: Aggressive Multi-Opener** → **4+ piles**
- Play BLACK STRAIGHT (3 piles) → **5 pile room remaining**
- Attempt both ADVISOR_RED and ADVISOR_BLACK in tight room
- **Risk**: Higher competition in limited remaining room (5 piles)

#### **Key Strategic Insights**:

1. **Starter Privilege Critical**: Controls when to play BLACK STRAIGHT (guaranteed 3 piles)
2. **Strategic Forfeiting**: Use medium/high pieces as forfeits instead of low-value pieces
3. **Room Management**: After 3-piece combo, 5 piles left creates competitive environment
4. **Risk-Reward Balance**: Option 2 (4 piles) offers optimal balance vs complexity

#### **Previous Assessment Flaws**:
- **Ignored starter advantage**: Massive oversight of guaranteed combo control
- **Missed forfeit strategy**: No consideration of strategic piece disposal

### SI-016: Room Constraint Precision

**Issue Identified**: `room_limited_04` test scenario had invalid hand description and expected overly optimistic outcome.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: room_limited_04
Hand: [ELEPHANT_RED, ELEPHANT_BLACK, CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Position: 3 (Last player, non-starter)
Previous declarations: [2, 2, 1]
Current expected: 2 → 1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Original Problem**: 
- Hand description claimed "THREE_OF_A_KIND ELEPHANT" but only had 2 ELEPHANT pieces (one RED, one BLACK)
- No valid THREE_OF_A_KIND possible with different colored pieces
- Expected 2 piles despite fundamental rule violation

#### **Actual Hand Assessment**:
1. **Potential ELEPHANT Pair**: ELEPHANT_RED + ELEPHANT_BLACK → **NOT VALID** (different colors)
2. **Available Pieces**: Mix of medium-strength singles
3. **Room Available**: 8 - (2+2+1) = 3 piles
4. **Position**: Last player, non-starter = needs opportunity

#### **Correct Strategic Assessment**:
- **No Valid Combos**: No pairs possible due to color mismatch
- **Best Pieces**: ELEPHANT_RED (10pts) strongest available
- **Room vs Capability**: Room=3 available, but only 1 reliable pile achievable
- **Conservative Strategy**: In last position with medium pieces, declare 1 pile safely

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Enhanced Rule Validation**:
   - Strict same-color requirements for pairs
   - Prevent invalid combo identification
   - Clear error reporting for rule violations

2. **Room vs Hand Analysis**:
   - Realistic assessment of achievable piles

   - Prioritize achievable over theoretical maximum

3. **Test Scenario Accuracy**:
   - Valid hand descriptions matching strategic notes
   - Correct expected values based on actual game rules

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Precision in constraint handling

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly identifies invalid color combinations
- Realistic room constraint assessment
- Conservative strategies for medium-strength hands in poor positions

---

### SI-017: Hand Capability vs Room Assessment

**Issue Identified**: `room_mismatch_02` scenario overestimated single opener capability in normal field conditions.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: room_mismatch_02
Hand: [GENERAL_BLACK, ELEPHANT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, ELEPHANT_BLACK]
Position: 2 (Non-starter)
Previous declarations: [1, 2]
Current expected: 2 → 1 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Hand Assessment**:
1. **Reliable Opener**: GENERAL_BLACK (13 points) - Very strong
2. **Secondary Pieces**: ELEPHANT_RED (10pts), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9pts)
3. **Room Available**: 8 - (1+2) = 5 piles
4. **Field Strength**: Previous [1,2] = borderline normal field

#### **Strategic Reasoning**:
- **Single Strong Piece Strategy**: GENERAL_BLACK highly reliable for 1 pile
- **Secondary Piece Risk**: ELEPHANT pieces (9-10pts) marginal against normal field
- **Conservative Choice**: Room exists (5 piles) but hand reliability doesn't justify higher risk

#### **Key Strategic Insight**:
**Room availability ≠ hand capability** - Large room doesn't automatically justify higher declarations when hand strength is concentrated in single opener.

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Hand vs Room Analysis**:
   - Separate room availability from achievable pile assessment
   - Weight hand strength concentration vs spread
   - Conservative bias when capability is single-point dependent

2. **Opener Reliability Scoring**:
   - Account for field strength in opener assessment
   - Secondary piece risk evaluation
   - Gradual degradation vs cliff-drop reliability patterns

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Fundamental resource assessment logic

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI distinguishes room availability from capability
- Conservative strategies with single-point strength concentration
- Proper field strength impact on secondary pieces

---

### SI-018: Position Control + Large Combo Interaction

**Issue Identified**: `room_mismatch_03` ignored fundamental position control requirements for large combos.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: room_mismatch_03
Hand: [SOLDIER_RED×5, SOLDIER_BLACK, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK]
Position: 1 (Non-starter)
Previous declarations: [2]
Current expected: 5 → 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Hand Assets**:
1. **FIVE_OF_A_KIND_RED**: 5 SOLDIER_RED pieces = 5 piles if playable
2. **Room Available**: 8 - 2 = 6 piles (sufficient)
3. **Combo Quality**: 5×2 = 10 total points (weak but valid)

#### **Critical Position Analysis**:
- **Position 1**: Non-starter, cannot control when to play large combos
- **Previous [2]**: Single opponent declared 2 = normal strength, likely has combos/control
- **Opportunity Requirement**: FIVE_OF_A_KIND needs opponent to play 5 pieces first

#### **Strategic Reality Check**:
**Large combos without control = 0 piles in practice**

Scenarios where opponents play 5+ pieces:
1. **Very rare**: Most games focus on 1-3 piece plays
2. **Strong opponent control**: Player who declared 2 likely controls turn flow
3. **No guarantee**: Even if opportunity arises, combo might lose to stronger 5-piece plays

#### **Fundamental Strategic Principle**:
**Control > Combo Size** - Position control more valuable than combo potential

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Position Control Assessment**:
   - Heavy penalty for large combos without starter position
   - Opportunity probability calculation based on opponent declarations
   - Control mechanism requirements (openers, GENERAL_RED effects)

2. **Combo Size vs Position Weighting**:
   - Exponential penalty increase for combo size without control
   - Small combos (2-3) more viable without control than large combos (4+)
   - Field strength impact on opportunity assessment

3. **Reality-Based Combo Valuation**:
   - Consider actual game patterns for combo size frequency
   - Opponent behavior prediction based on declaration patterns

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Fundamental strategic principle

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI heavily penalizes large combos without control
- Position control properly weighted in decision making
- Realistic opportunity assessment for different combo sizes

---

### SI-019: Multi-Combo Control Requirements

**Issue Identified**: `room_mismatch_04` failed to consider control requirements for multiple combo strategy.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: room_mismatch_04
Hand: [CHARIOT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_RED, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_RED, CANNON_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK]
Position: 2 (Non-starter)
Previous declarations: [1, 1] 
Current expected: 6 → 0 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Hand Assets**:
1. **Three Potential Pairs**:
   - CHARIOT_RED + CHARIOT_BLACK → **INVALID** (different colors)
   - HORSE_RED + HORSE_BLACK → **INVALID** (different colors)  
   - CANNON_RED + CANNON_BLACK → **INVALID** (different colors)
2. **Actual Pairs**: None - all mixed color combinations
3. **Room Available**: 8 - (1+1) = 6 piles

#### **Strategic Reality**:
- **No Valid Combos**: All potential pairs fail same-color requirement
- **Singles Strategy**: Must rely on individual piece strength
- **Best Pieces**: CHARIOT_RED (8pts), HORSE_RED (6pts), CANNON_RED (4pts)
- **Field Assessment**: Previous [1,1] = weak field, singles-only opponents

#### **Corrected Assessment**:
In weak field [1,1], medium singles might be marginally viable, but without valid combos and in non-starter position, conservative 0 declaration appropriate.

#### **Key Strategic Learning**:
1. **Rule Precision Critical**: Invalid combo identification led to massive overvaluation
2. **Control Requirements**: Multiple combos exponentially more dependent on position control
3. **Field Reading**: Weak field [1,1] suggests opponents have singles-only strategies

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Strict Combo Validation**:
   - Same name AND same color requirements enforced
   - No false positive combo detection
   - Clear error reporting for invalid combinations

2. **Multi-Combo Position Analysis**:
   - Exponential control requirements for multiple combo strategies
   - Realistic opportunity assessment for playing multiple pairs
   - Conservative bias without starter position

3. **Singles Strategy Fallback**:
   - Assessment of medium singles in weak fields
   - Graduated risk evaluation for different piece strengths
   - Position penalty application to singles strategies

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Fundamental rule understanding + strategic principle

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly identifies same-color pair requirements
- Multi-combo strategies properly penalized without control
- Realistic fallback assessment for singles-based strategies

### SI-020: Strong vs Marginal Opener Classification

**Issue Identified**: `opener_marginal_05` incorrectly classified ADVISOR_BLACK (11pts) as a marginal opener when it's actually a strong opener.

**Corrected Scenario**:
```
Scenario ID: opener_marginal_05
Hand: [HORSE_RED, CANNON_RED, SOLDIER_RED, SOLDIER_BLACK, ELEPHANT_RED, CHARIOT_BLACK, ELEPHANT_BLACK, ADVISOR_BLACK]
Position: 3 (Last player, non-starter)
Previous declarations: [0, 0, 1]
Current expected: 1 → 2 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Opener Classification Issue**:
- **ADVISOR_BLACK**: 11 points = Strong opener (≥11pts threshold)
- **Miscategorized**: Listed in "marginal openers" subcategory
- **Field Strength**: Previous [0,0,1] = very weak field (avg = 0.33)

#### **Correct Assessment**:
1. **Strong Opener in Weak Field**: ADVISOR_BLACK + very weak field = extremely reliable
2. **Reliability Score**: 1.0 in weak field (perfect reliability)
3. **Secondary Assets**: ELEPHANT_RED (10pts), ELEPHANT_BLACK (9pts) as backup
4. **Conservative Undervaluation**: Expected 1 when hand easily supports 2 piles

#### **Strategic Insights**:
- **Opener Thresholds**: 11+ points = strong opener regardless of context
- **Field Strength Multiplier**: Very weak field [0,0,1] amplifies opener reliability
- **Multi-Asset Hands**: ADVISOR + multiple ELEPHANTs provides redundancy

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Opener Classification System**:
   - Clear thresholds: Strong (≥11pts), Marginal (9-10pts), None (<9pts)
   - Prevent misclassification of strong openers
   - Field-dependent reliability scoring

2. **Weak Field Bonus**:
   - Amplified opener reliability in weak fields
   - Higher declaration potential when opponents are very weak
   - Conservative baseline vs aggressive optimization

3. **Multi-Asset Assessment**:
   - Consider backup pieces for additional reliability
   - Graduated risk assessment with multiple viable pieces
   - Position constraint accommodation

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Classification precision important for opener strategy

**Validation Requirements**:
- AI correctly classifies strong vs marginal openers
- Weak field conditions properly amplify opener reliability
- Appropriate aggression level with strong opener + weak field combination

### SI-021: GENERAL_RED Combo Accumulation Logic Flaw (CRITICAL AI IMPLEMENTATION BUG)

**Issue Identified**: AI implementation bug in `backend/engine/ai.py` lines 271-282 prevents GENERAL_RED from utilizing multiple combos simultaneously.

**Affected Scenarios**: 
- `general_red_01`: Expected 8, AI gives 5 (-3 gap)
- `general_red_combo_03`: Expected 6, AI gives 5 (-1 gap)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```python
# Lines 271-282 in choose_declare_strategic()
if context.has_general_red and any(c[0] in ["FOUR_OF_A_KIND", "FIVE_OF_A_KIND"] for c in viable_combos):
    # Focus on the strongest combo only  ← BUG: Should accumulate ALL viable combos
    for combo_type, pieces in sorted_combos:
        if combo_type in ["FOUR_OF_A_KIND", "FIVE_OF_A_KIND"]:
            # ... scoring logic ...
            break  # ← BUG: Exits after first combo instead of continuing
```

**Strategic Impact**:
- **general_red_01**: Hand has FOUR_OF_A_KIND_BLACK(4) + STRAIGHT_RED(3) + GENERAL_RED opener(1) = 8 total capability
- **AI Behavior**: Artificially limits to strongest combo only, missing GENERAL_RED's core game-changing value
- **Strategic Flaw**: GENERAL_RED's fundamental advantage is enabling MULTIPLE combos through guaranteed control

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Fix Combo Accumulation Logic**:
   - Remove artificial single-combo limitation for GENERAL_RED hands
   - Allow full combo accumulation when GENERAL_RED provides control
   - Maintain 8-piece hand constraint properly

2. **GENERAL_RED Special Case Enhancement**:
   - Model GENERAL_RED's unique ability to guarantee multiple combo plays
   - Account for strategic tempo control through strongest opener
   - Balance guaranteed combos with piece efficiency

### SI-022: GENERAL_RED Combo Enablement Filtering (CRITICAL AI IMPLEMENTATION BUG)

**Issue Identified**: `filter_viable_combos()` function too conservative in normal field conditions when GENERAL_RED provides guaranteed control.

**Affected Scenarios**: 
- `general_red_combo_01`: Expected 4, AI gives 1 (-3 gap)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```python
# In filter_viable_combos() around line 135-137
elif context.has_general_red and context.field_strength == "weak":
    # GENERAL_RED in weak field acts like starter
    viable.append((combo_type, pieces))  # ← Should also work in normal fields
```

**Strategic Impact**:
- **Scenario Context**: Normal field [1,2], GENERAL_RED + THREE_OF_A_KIND_RED available
- **Expected Strategy**: GENERAL_RED(14pts) should guarantee control to play THREE_OF_A_KIND + opener = 4 piles
- **AI Behavior**: Filters out combo, only counts opener = 1 pile
- **Strategic Flaw**: GENERAL_RED(14 points) should guarantee control even in normal fields

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Enhance Combo Enablement Logic**:
   - Extend GENERAL_RED combo enablement beyond just "weak" fields
   - Model guaranteed control in normal field conditions
   - Maintain appropriate filtering for truly strong opponent scenarios

2. **Control Mechanism Assessment**:
   - GENERAL_RED should override normal combo opportunity requirements
   - Balance guaranteed control vs opponent strength realistically
   - Preserve strategic challenge in strong field scenarios

**Implementation Priority**: CRITICAL - Fundamental GENERAL_RED strategic principle

**Status**: AI Implementation Bug - Requires code-level fix, not test scenario correction

---

### SI-023: Multi-Opener Strategic Value Gap (HIGH PRIORITY AI IMPLEMENTATION)

**Issue Identified**: AI doesn't properly value strategic flexibility when multiple premium openers are available.

**Affected Scenarios**: 
- `general_red_03`: Expected 3, AI gives 2 (-1 gap)

**Strategic Analysis**:
- **Hand Assets**: GENERAL_RED(14pts) + ADVISOR_BLACK(11pts) = two guaranteed winners

**Status**: AI Implementation Gap - Enhancement opportunity

---

### SI-024: Weak Field Domination Missing (HIGH PRIORITY AI IMPLEMENTATION)

**Issue Identified**: AI doesn't model GENERAL_RED's strength dominance in very weak fields.

**Affected Scenarios**: 
- `general_red_field_01`: Expected 2, AI gives 1 (-1 gap)

**Strategic Analysis**:
- **Field Context**: Very weak field [0,0] = opponents have terrible hands
- **Hand Assets**: GENERAL_RED(14pts) + ELEPHANT_RED(10pts) 
- **Strategic Reality**: In very weak field, both pieces should easily win
- **Current Logic**: Only counts GENERAL_RED, ignores secondary piece strength advantage
- **Missing Value**: Strength dominance exploitation in weak fields

**Technical Requirements**:

   - Maintain conservative approach in mixed/strong fields

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Strategic completeness

**Status**: AI Implementation Gap - Enhancement opportunity

---

### SI-025: Must-Declare-Nonzero Constraint Ignored (CRITICAL AI IMPLEMENTATION BUG)

**Issue Identified**: AI implementation completely ignores `must_declare_nonzero` constraint, causing game rule violations.

**Affected Scenarios**: All 4 scenarios fail (0/4 passing)
- `edge_nonzero_01`: Expected 1, AI gives 0 (rule violation)
- `edge_nonzero_02`: Expected 3, AI gives 1 (undervaluation)  
- `edge_nonzero_03`: Expected 1, AI gives 0 (rule violation)
- `edge_nonzero_04`: Expected 1, AI gives 0 (rule violation)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Constraint Application**: Lines 343-346 in `choose_declare_strategic()` handle forbidden values but execute AFTER base score calculation
- **Logic Gap**: `must_declare_nonzero` parameter passed to function but never used in constraint logic
- **Critical Impact**: AI makes illegal moves that would be rejected by game engine

**Strategic Impact**:
- **Game Rule Violations**: 75% of nonzero scenarios result in illegal moves
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: AI cannot handle mandatory declaration scenarios
- **System Integrity**: Fundamental constraint handling failure

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Immediate Constraint Integration**:
   - Check `must_declare_nonzero` constraint before any strategic calculation
   - Add 0 to forbidden_declares set when constraint is active
   - Ensure constraint takes precedence over strategic preferences

2. **Emergency Fallback Logic**:
   - When all preferred options forbidden, select minimum viable alternative
   - Implement strategic alternative selection (conservative vs aggressive)
   - Prevent system crashes from impossible constraint combinations

**Implementation Priority**: CRITICAL - Game rule compliance essential

**Status**: AI Implementation Bug - Fundamental constraint system missing

### SI-026: Sum≠8 Constraint Partial Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY AI IMPLEMENTATION BUG)

**Issue Identified**: Last player sum≠8 constraint only works in 1/4 scenarios, causing strategic decision errors.

**Affected Scenarios**: 3/4 scenarios fail
- `edge_forbidden_01`: Expected 1, AI gives 1 ✅ (working correctly)
- `edge_forbidden_02`: Expected 4, AI gives 2 (strategic undervaluation)
- `edge_forbidden_03`: Expected 1, AI gives 0 (constraint resolution failure)
- `edge_forbidden_04`: Expected 1, AI gives 0 (constraint resolution failure)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Constraint Detection**: Lines 337-341 correctly identify forbidden values
- **Resolution Strategy**: Lines 348-357 use basic "closest option" without strategic context
- **Strategic Integration Gap**: Constraint resolution ignores hand strength and context

**Strategic Impact**:
- **edge_forbidden_02**: Hand with GENERAL_RED + THREE_OF_A_KIND should declare 4, not 2
- **edge_forbidden_03/04**: Constraint resolution chooses 0 instead of viable alternative 1
- **Lost Opportunities**: Conservative constraint handling ignores strong hand potential

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Strategic Constraint Resolution**:
   - Consider hand strength when resolving forbidden value conflicts
   - Prefer strategic alternatives that match hand capability
   - Balance constraint compliance with competitive opportunity

2. **Context-Aware Alternative Selection**:
   - Strong hands should prefer higher alternatives when possible
   - Weak hands should prefer conservative alternatives
   - Maintain strategic coherence in constraint resolution

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Constraint handling strategic accuracy

**Status**: AI Implementation Bug - Constraint resolution logic incomplete

### SI-027: Boundary Condition Overconfidence (HIGH PRIORITY AI IMPLEMENTATION BUG)

**Issue Identified**: AI declares maximum possible (8) for extreme hands regardless of strategic merit.

**Affected Scenarios**: 2/4 boundary scenarios fail
- `edge_boundary_01`: Expected 4, AI gives 8 (overconfident with perfect openers)
- `edge_boundary_02`: Expected 1, AI gives 8 (overconfident with weakest pieces)
- `edge_boundary_03`: Expected 1, AI gives 1 ✅ (correctly handled)
- `edge_boundary_04`: Expected 6, AI gives 7 (close but overconfident)

**Strategic Analysis**:

**edge_boundary_01 - Perfect Opener Overconfidence**:
- **Hand**: GENERAL_RED + ADVISOR_RED + all premium pieces
- **Strategic Reality**: Perfect openers don't guarantee 8 piles due to piece efficiency
- **Correct Strategy**: Declare 4 (strategic aggression without overcommitment)

**edge_boundary_02 - Weakest Hand Overconfidence**:
- **Hand**: All SOLDIER pieces (1-2 points each)
- **Strategic Reality**: Starter advantage minimal with weakest pieces
- **Correct Strategy**: Declare 1 (ultra-conservative with weak pieces)

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Boundary Condition Strategic Logic**:
   - Maximum opener hands: Cap declarations at strategic level (4-5)
   - Minimum piece hands: Ultra-conservative approach regardless of position
   - Extreme composition recognition and appropriate strategic response

2. **Overconfidence Prevention**:
   - Upper bound checking based on realistic pile achievement
   - Strategic reasonableness validation for extreme declarations
   - Risk management for boundary condition scenarios

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Risk management and strategic reasonableness

**Status**: AI Implementation Bug - Boundary condition logic missing

### SI-015: Maximum Combo Strategy (VALIDATED)

**Issue Status**: **ALREADY CORRECT** - Test scenario properly expects 8, validating maximum combo potential

**Validated Scenario**:
```
combo_multi_06: GENERAL + FOUR_OF_A_KIND + STRAIGHT in weak field, expects 8 ✅
```

**Strategic Analysis**:

#### **Perfect Maximum Combo Hand**:
- **Hand**: `[GENERAL_BLACK, SOLDIER_RED×4, CHARIOT_BLACK, HORSE_BLACK, CANNON_BLACK]`
- **Position**: Non-starter but irrelevant due to GENERAL_BLACK
- **Field**: [1, 0] = weak field, perfect for combo play

#### **Available Maximum Combos**:
1. **GENERAL_BLACK opener**: 13 points → 1 pile (strongest opener)
2. **RED FOUR_OF_A_KIND**: SOLDIER_RED×4 → 4 piles (premium combo)
3. **BLACK STRAIGHT**: CHARIOT_BLACK + HORSE_BLACK + CANNON_BLACK → 3 piles (solid combo)
4. **Total**: 1 + 4 + 3 = **8 piles maximum** ✅

#### **Strategic Validation**:

**GENERAL_BLACK Game-Changing Power**:
- **Overcomes position disadvantage**: Non-starter becomes irrelevant
- **Enables complete combo control**: Can play all combos optimally
- **Field exploitation**: [1, 0] weak field perfect for maximum combo strategy

**Perfect Combo Synergy**:
- **Maximum theoretical piles**: 8 out of 8 possible
- **No piece waste**: Every piece contributes to optimal strategy
- **Weak field advantage**: Opponents can't interfere with combo execution

**Technical Validation**:
This scenario validates the AI's ability to:
- Recognize maximum combo potential
- Properly weight GENERAL pieces as game-changers
- Exploit weak field conditions for maximum combo play
- Calculate optimal multi-combo strategies

**Implementation Requirements**:
- GENERAL pieces should override position disadvantages
- Maximum combo detection when all pieces contribute
- Weak field exploitation for combo-heavy hands
- Proper calculation of theoretical maximum piles (8)

**Validation Success**: Test correctly expects 8, demonstrating proper understanding of maximum combo potential with game-changing opener.

## Strategic Categories

### Information Asymmetry
Strategic scenarios where unknown players create disproportionate risk due to uneven information distribution.

**Key Principles**:
- When multiple known players are weak, remaining unknown players statistically more likely to be strong
- Without control mechanisms (openers/combos), conservative play protects against concentrated threats
- Medium-strength hands become vulnerable in asymmetric scenarios

### Field Assessment
Strategic evaluation of opponent strength based on declarations and visible information.

### Combo Assessment  
Strategic evaluation of combination viability based on control and opportunity factors.

### Opener Reliability
Strategic evaluation of single-piece openers based on field strength and position.
