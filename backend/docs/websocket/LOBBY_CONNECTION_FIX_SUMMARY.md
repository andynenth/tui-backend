# Lobby Connection Fix Summary

Date: January 28, 2025

## Problem Analysis

The log file revealed critical errors when WebSocket connections were made to the lobby:

```
ResourceNotFoundException: Room with id 'lobby' not found
```

This occurred because the `client_ready` use case was trying to look up a room entity for 'lobby', but lobby connections don't have associated room entities in the database.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Ready Use Case (High Priority) ✅

**Problem**: The `mark_client_ready.py` use case always tried to fetch a room from the database, even for lobby connections.

**Solution**: Added special handling for lobby connections:
- Check if `room_id == "lobby"` at the beginning of the execute method
- Return a successful response without room lookup for lobby connections
- Still record metrics for lobby connections

**File Modified**: `application/use_cases/connection/mark_client_ready.py`

### 2. WebSocket ID Tracking (Medium Priority) ✅

**Problem**: The API layer's connection manager wasn't tracking WebSocket IDs for lobby connections, causing warnings during disconnect:
```
WebSocket ID {id} not found in mapping. Current mappings: []
```

**Solution**: Added automatic registration of lobby connections with the API connection manager:
- Use anonymous player names for lobby connections (e.g., `anonymous_2025813e`)
- Register with connection manager immediately after infrastructure registration

**File Modified**: `api/routes/ws.py`

### 3. Lobby Event Handlers (Medium Priority) ✅

**Status**: No changes needed. The lobby event handlers (`request_room_list`, `get_rooms`) were already correctly implemented and don't require room entities.

## Test Script Created

Created `tests/test_lobby_connection_fix.py` to verify:
1. Basic lobby connection establishment
2. `client_ready` event handling
3. `request_room_list` event handling
4. `ping/pong` functionality
5. Multiple simultaneous connections
6. Proper disconnect handling

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Lobby connections succeed** without "Room not found" errors
2. **client_ready events** are acknowledged properly for lobby
3. **WebSocket disconnections** are tracked without warnings
4. **Frontend receives** proper acknowledgments and can proceed with lobby operations

## Implementation Details

### Modified client_ready Use Case:
```python
# Special handling for lobby connections
if request.room_id == "lobby":
    logger.info(f"Client ready for lobby connection: player_id={request.player_id}")
    
    # Record metrics for lobby
    if self._metrics:
        self._metrics.increment("player.ready", tags={
            "room_id": "lobby",
            "client_version": request.client_version or "unknown"
        })
    
    # Return success response for lobby
    return MarkClientReadyResponse(
        success=True,
        request_id=request.request_id,
        player_id=request.player_id,
        is_ready=True,
        room_state_provided=False
    )
```

### WebSocket Registration for Lobby:
```python
# For lobby connections, register with the API connection manager as anonymous
if room_id == "lobby":
    # Use a unique anonymous identifier for lobby connections
    anonymous_player = f"anonymous_{websocket._ws_id[:8]}"
    await connection_manager.register_player(room_id, anonymous_player, websocket._ws_id)
    logger.info(f"Registered anonymous lobby connection: {anonymous_player}")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** when the server is running to verify fixes
2. **Monitor logs** for any remaining WebSocket-related errors
3. **Consider refactoring** the connection manager to better handle anonymous connections
4. **Update documentation** to clarify the distinction between lobby and room connections
