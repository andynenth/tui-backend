# Phase 3 Day 3 Completion Report - Game Events Migration

## Overview
Added all 10 game events to direct use case routing, but encountered the same validation incompatibility issues as Day 2.

## Events Migrated

### Game Flow Events
1. **start_game** - Added to use_case_events, fixed `requesting_player_id` field
2. **declare** - Added to use_case_events, changed to use `game_id` instead of `room_id`
3. **play** / **play_pieces** - Added both aliases, changed to use `game_id`

### Redeal Events
4. **request_redeal** - Added to use_case_events, uses `game_id` and `hand_strength_score`
5. **accept_redeal** - Added to use_case_events, includes `redeal_id`
6. **decline_redeal** - Added to use_case_events, includes `redeal_id`
7. **redeal_decision** - Added to use_case_events, routes to accept/decline based on decision

### Other Game Events
8. **player_ready** - Added to use_case_events, fixed to use `MarkPlayerReadyRequest`
9. **leave_game** - Added to use_case_events, uses `game_id`

## DTO Fixes Applied

### Field Name Corrections
- `requester_id` → `requesting_player_id` (StartGameRequest)
- `room_id` → `game_id` (all game DTOs expect game_id)
- `ready_state` → `ready_for_phase` (MarkPlayerReadyRequest)
- Added missing `redeal_id` fields for redeal voting

### Request Class Corrections
- `PlayerReadyRequest` → `MarkPlayerReadyRequest`

## Validation Issues Discovered

### Legacy Validation Requirements
The validation layer (`websocket_validators.py`) enforces:
- `player_name` for: declare, play, request_redeal, accept_redeal, decline_redeal
- `value` instead of `pile_count` for declare
- Different field expectations than clean architecture DTOs

### Impact
- ALL game events fail validation with "Player name is required"
- Validation strips out fields that use cases need (e.g., `player_id`, `game_id`)
- Cannot properly test game event functionality

## Test Results

Created `test_game_events_integration.py`:
- ✅ Test script runs and connects successfully
- ❌ All game events fail due to validation requiring `player_name`
- ❌ Cannot test actual use case functionality

## Configuration Update

Updated `websocket_config.py` to include all 10 game events:
```python
# Game events (Day 3 migration)
"start_game", "declare", "play", "play_pieces",
"request_redeal", "accept_redeal", "decline_redeal",
"redeal_decision", "player_ready", "leave_game"
```

## Analysis

### Root Cause
The legacy validation layer was designed for a different message format where:
- Players were identified by `player_name` in every message
- Game state was implicit (no `game_id` needed)
- Room context provided game information

The clean architecture uses:
- `player_id` for identification (from WebSocket context)
- Explicit `game_id` for all game operations
- DTOs with specific field requirements

### Migration Blocker
This validation incompatibility blocks proper testing of the migrated events. The use case handlers are ready, but messages cannot reach them in the correct format.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Options
1. **Bypass Validation**: Skip validation for events in `use_case_events`
2. **Add Translation Layer**: Transform legacy format to DTO format
3. **Update Validation**: Modify validators to support both formats

### Best Path Forward
Continue with Phase 3 completion:
- Day 4: Update integration tests with workarounds
- Day 5: Remove legacy validation as part of adapter removal

## Status Summary

- **Events Migrated**: 22/22 (100%) ✅
- **Events Working**: ~6/22 (connection and some lobby events)
- **Blocking Issue**: Legacy validation incompatibility
- **Next Step**: Day 4 - Integration testing with workarounds
