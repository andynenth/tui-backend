# Phase 3: Remove Adapter System - Progress Report

## Date: 2025-01-28
## Status: In Progress (Day 1)

### Executive Summary

Phase 3 implementation has begun with the creation of the UseCaseDispatcher and migration configuration system. Connection and lobby events (6 events) have been successfully migrated to direct use case integration.

### What Has Been Accomplished

#### 1. Created UseCaseDispatcher (`application/websocket/use_case_dispatcher.py`)
- Direct integration between WebSocket messages and use cases
- Handles DTO transformation inline
- Manages all 22 WebSocket events
- Gracefully handles missing game services
- ~900 lines of well-structured code

#### 2. Created WebSocket Configuration System (`application/websocket/websocket_config.py`)
- Three routing modes: ADAPTER, USE_CASE, MIGRATION
- Environment-based configuration
- Supports gradual event migration
- Default: Connection and lobby events use direct integration

#### 3. Updated MessageRouter
- Now supports both adapter and direct routing
- Uses configuration to determine routing per event
- Lazy loads adapter wrapper for migration mode
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### 4. Migrated Connection & Lobby Events
Successfully migrated 6 events to direct use case integration:

**Connection Events (4):**
- `ping` → HandlePingUseCase
- `client_ready` → MarkClientReadyUseCase
- `ack` → AcknowledgeMessageUseCase
- `sync_request` → SyncClientStateUseCase

**Lobby Events (2):**
- `request_room_list` → GetRoomListUseCase
- `get_rooms` → GetRoomListUseCase (alias)

### Architecture Benefits Realized

1. **Code Reduction**: Eliminated adapter layer for migrated events
2. **Direct Flow**: WebSocket → MessageRouter → UseCaseDispatcher → Use Cases
3. **Type Safety**: Direct DTO usage ensures type correctness
4. **Performance**: Fewer async hops (4-5 → 2-3)

### Migration Strategy

Using environment variables for controlled rollout:
```bash
# Migration mode (default)
WEBSOCKET_ROUTING_MODE=migration
USE_CASE_EVENTS=ping,client_ready,ack,sync_request,request_room_list,get_rooms

# Full use case mode (when ready)
WEBSOCKET_ROUTING_MODE=use_case

# Rollback to adapters if needed
WEBSOCKET_ROUTING_MODE=adapter
```

### Challenges Addressed

1. **Missing Game Services**: Made game services optional with graceful degradation
2. **DTO Naming**: Updated to use correct DTO class names from connection module
3. **Import Issues**: Resolved circular imports and missing dependencies

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `/backend/application/websocket/use_case_dispatcher.py`
- `/backend/application/websocket/websocket_config.py`
- `/backend/tests/application/websocket/test_use_case_dispatcher.py`
- `/backend/test_direct_integration.py` (test script)

**Modified:**
- `/backend/application/websocket/message_router.py`
- `/backend/application/websocket/__init__.py`

### Next Steps (Days 2-5)

**Day 2: Room Management Events**
- [ ] Update configuration to include room events
- [ ] Test room creation, joining, leaving
- [ ] Verify legacy visibility sync

**Day 3: Game Events**
- [ ] Add game events to configuration
- [ ] Implement game service initialization
- [ ] Test game flow end-to-end

**Day 4: Integration Testing**
- [ ] Update integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Load testing

**Day 5: Cleanup**
- [ ] Remove adapter files
- [ ] Update imports throughout codebase
- [ ] Final documentation

### Metrics

- **Events Migrated**: 6/22 (27%)
- **Code Lines Added**: ~1,200
- **Code Lines to Remove**: ~2,500 (adapters)
- **Net Reduction**: ~1,300 lines (52%)

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Connection and lobby events are stateless and read-only
**Medium Risk**: Room events require state management and legacy sync
**High Risk**: Game events have complex state machine interactions

### Recommendation

Continue with Day 2 plan to migrate room management events. The gradual migration approach is working well and allows for easy rollback if issues arise.

### Success Indicators

✅ Direct integration pattern established
✅ Configuration system allows controlled migration
✅ Connection/lobby events working correctly
✅ Tests passing for migrated functionality
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
