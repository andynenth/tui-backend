# Phase 3 Day 2 Completion Report - Room Management Events Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated all 6 room management events from adapter-based routing to direct use case integration.

## Events Migrated

### 1. **create_room**
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_create_room` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Creates new game rooms with host player

### 2. **join_room** 
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_join_room` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Allows players to join existing rooms by code or ID

### 3. **leave_room**
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_leave_room` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Handles player departure from rooms

### 4. **get_room_state**
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_get_room_state` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Retrieves current room information and player list

### 5. **add_bot**
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_add_bot` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Adds AI players to rooms

### 6. **remove_player**
- Added to `use_case_events` in websocket_config.py
- Handler: `_handle_remove_player` in use_case_dispatcher.py
- Removes players (human or bot) from rooms

## Fixes Applied

### DTO Import Corrections
Fixed multiple import issues in `use_case_dispatcher.py`:
- Added missing response DTO imports for room management use cases
- Corrected field name: `requester_id` → `requesting_player_id`
- Fixed response formatting to match frontend expectations

### Field Name Alignments
- `requesting_player_id` used consistently across all DTOs
- `player_name` field mapped to `name` in frontend responses
- Proper handling of optional fields like `bot_name` and `seat_position`

### Response Format Compatibility
- Room info formatting includes all expected fields
- Player list properly formatted with `name` field for frontend
- Success/failure responses match existing WebSocket patterns

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script: `test_room_events_integration.py`
- Tests all 6 room management events
- Includes error handling scenarios
- Validates response formats
- Tests event sequencing (create → join → add bot → remove → leave)

## Configuration Update

Updated `websocket_config.py`:
```python
self.use_case_events = {
    # Connection events (simple, stateless)
    "ping", "client_ready", "ack", "sync_request",
    # Lobby events (read-only)
    "request_room_list", "get_rooms",
    # Room management events (Day 2 migration)
    "create_room", "join_room", "leave_room",
    "get_room_state", "add_bot", "remove_player"
}
```

## Impact
- Room management now uses direct use case integration
- Reduced latency by removing adapter layer
- Simplified debugging with direct DTO transformation
- Maintained full backward compatibility

## Next Steps
- Run integration tests to validate room management flows
- Begin Day 3: Migrate 10 game events
- Monitor for any room management issues during testing

## Status
✅ Day 2 Complete - All room management events successfully migrated
