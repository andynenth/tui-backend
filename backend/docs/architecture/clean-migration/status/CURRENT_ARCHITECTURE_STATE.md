# Current Architecture State (Post-Phase 7 Completion)

## 🎯 TL;DR
- **Clean architecture is the ONLY architecture** - all legacy code removed
- **Zero legacy dependencies** - imports updated to use clean components
- **No warnings or cosmetic issues** - system runs cleanly

## 📊 What's Actually Running

### ✅ Clean Architecture (100% Active)
All business logic flows through clean architecture:
- Room management → `application.services.room_application_service`
- Game actions → `application.services.game_application_service`  
- Lobby operations → `application.services.lobby_application_service`
- Connection handling → `application.services.connection_application_service`
- WebSocket adapters → `api.adapters.*`

### ✅ Infrastructure Components
- `ws.py` - WebSocket infrastructure with adapter integration
- `infrastructure/websocket/connection_singleton.py` - Broadcasting functionality
- `infrastructure/repositories/*` - Data persistence
- `infrastructure/events/*` - Event publishing system

### ✅ Enterprise Architecture
- `engine/state_machine/*` - Modern state machine implementation
- Automatic broadcasting system
- Event sourcing with history tracking
- JSON-safe serialization

## 🚦 How Traffic Flows

```
1. WebSocket message arrives at ws.py
2. ws.py passes to adapter_wrapper (integrated adapter system)
3. Adapter routes to appropriate application service
4. Application service coordinates domain logic
5. Infrastructure handles persistence and broadcasting
6. Response sent back to client
```

## ✅ Phase 7 Completion Summary

**Phase 7 completed on 2025-07-28** with:
1. **140 legacy files permanently removed**
2. **All imports updated to clean architecture**
3. **Temporary adapter files removed after migration**
4. **Full backup created**: `legacy_backup_phase7_20250728.tar.gz`
5. **Zero downtime during migration**

## 🎮 System Status

**FULLY OPERATIONAL** with clean architecture:
- No legacy code remaining
- All features working correctly
- Performance maintained or improved
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full frontend compatibility maintained

## 🔧 Configuration

Current setup in `start.sh`:
```bash
# Adapter routing (100% traffic through clean architecture)
export ADAPTER_ENABLED=true
export ADAPTER_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=100

# Clean architecture feature flags (all enabled)
export FF_USE_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE=true
export FF_USE_DOMAIN_EVENTS=true
export FF_USE_APPLICATION_SERVICES=true
export FF_USE_CLEAN_REPOSITORIES=true
export FF_USE_INFRASTRUCTURE_SERVICES=true
```

## 📁 Final Architecture Structure

```
backend/
├── domain/              # 36 files - Pure business logic
├── application/         # 54 files - Use cases and services
├── infrastructure/      # 123 files - External integrations
├── api/                 # 56 files - HTTP/WebSocket endpoints
├── engine/state_machine/ # 17 files - Enterprise architecture
└── tests/              # Clean architecture tests only

Total: 375+ files (100% clean architecture)
Legacy: 0 files (all removed)
```

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Where did the legacy code go?**
A: All 140 legacy files have been permanently removed. A backup exists in `legacy_backup_phase7_20250728.tar.gz` for emergency rollback.

**Q: What happened to shared_instances and socket_manager?**
A: Replaced with clean architecture equivalents. Broadcasting now uses `infrastructure/websocket/connection_singleton.py`.

**Q: Is ws.py still hybrid?**
A: No, ws.py is now pure infrastructure. All legacy handlers have been removed.

**Q: How do I identify architecture components?**
A: All code now follows clean architecture patterns. Check the directory structure above.

**Q: What about the warnings mentioned in Phase 6?**
A: All warnings have been eliminated. The system runs cleanly with no cosmetic issues.
