## Current Status

- **Phase 6**: âœ… Complete - Clean architecture implemented and handling 100% of traffic
- **Phase 7**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Legacy code removal strategy documented and ready

## Key Achievements

1. Successfully fixed 216 attribute mismatches between domain and application layers
2. Created PropertyMapper utility for seamless layer translation
3. Connected all WebSocket adapters to clean architecture
4. Maintained system stability throughout migration

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 7.0 - Update ws.py to use clean architecture repositories
2. Begin Phase 7.1 - Legacy code audit and marking
3. Complete Phase 7 - Full legacy code removal
