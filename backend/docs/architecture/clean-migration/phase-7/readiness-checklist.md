## üìä Daily Monitoring Tasks (July 27 - August 10)

### Morning Check (9:00 AM)
1. **Review overnight metrics**
   ```bash
   # Check error logs
   grep -i "error\|exception" /log.txt | tail -50
   
   # Check for legacy code usage
   grep -i "legacy\|shared_room_manager\|shared_bot_manager" /log.txt | tail -20
   
   # Verify clean architecture routing
   grep "ADAPTER-ONLY MODE" /log.txt | tail -5
   ```

2. **Performance spot check**
   - Average response times
   - Current active games
   - Memory usage trend

3. **User feedback review**
   - Support tickets
   - User reports
   - Community feedback

### Afternoon Check (3:00 PM)
1. **Peak load analysis**
   - Concurrent users
   - Game creation rate
   - WebSocket connections

2. **Error rate calculation**
   - Total requests
   - Failed requests
   - Error percentage

3. **System health verification**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:5050/api/health/detailed
   
   # Architecture verification
   python verify_architecture_status.py
   ```

### End of Day Report (6:00 PM)
1. **Daily summary**
   - Incidents: ___
   - Error rate: ___%
   - Performance: ___
   - User issues: ___

2. **Trend analysis**
   - Compare to previous days
   - Identify patterns
   - Flag concerns

## üö® Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### GO Criteria (All must be true)
- ‚úÖ 14+ days of stable operation
- ‚úÖ Zero production incidents
- ‚úÖ Error rate consistently < 0.1%
- ‚úÖ Performance equal or better than baseline
- ‚úÖ All cross-dependencies resolved
- ‚úÖ Team confident in rollback procedures

### NO-GO Criteria (Any one triggers delay)
- ‚ùå Any production incident in last 7 days
- ‚ùå Error rate spike > 0.5%
- ‚ùå Performance degradation > 10%
- ‚ùå Unresolved cross-dependencies
- ‚ùå Team concerns about stability
- ‚ùå Incomplete documentation

## üìà Monitoring Commands

### Quick Status Checks
```bash
# Current architecture distribution
cd backend && python tools/identify_architecture_type.py --directory . | head -20

# Find cross-dependencies
cd backend && python tools/identify_architecture_type.py --directory . --output deps.json
grep -A5 "cross_dependencies" deps.json

# Verify adapter routing
grep "ADAPTER-ONLY MODE\|adapter_wrapper" /log.txt | tail -20

# Check for legacy warnings
grep -i "legacy\|deprecated\|shared_.*_manager" /log.txt | grep -v "expected" | tail -20
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Response time analysis (requires log parsing)
grep "INFO.*WebSocket.*ms" /log.txt | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -n | tail -20

# Concurrent connections
netstat -an | grep :5050 | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

# Memory usage
ps aux | grep python | grep backend | awk '{print $6}'
```

## üîÑ Weekly Review Meeting Agenda

### Every Monday until Phase 7 start:
1. **Metrics Review** (15 min)
   - Error rates trend
   - Performance metrics
   - User feedback summary

2. **Technical Status** (20 min)
   - Cross-dependency progress
   - Hybrid file analysis
   - Architecture verification results

3. **Risk Assessment** (15 min)
   - New risks identified
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Confidence level

4. **Go/No-Go Discussion** (10 min)
   - Checklist review
   - Team sentiment
   - Decision or delay

## üìù Cross-Dependency Tracking

### Known Issues (6 files with legacy dependencies)
To be identified by running:
```bash
cd backend && python tools/identify_architecture_type.py --directory . --output full_analysis.json --verbose
# Then examine the cross_dependencies section
```

### Resolution Template
For each cross-dependency found:
1. **File**: `path/to/clean/file.py`
2. **Legacy Import**: `from engine.xxx import yyy`
3. **Clean Replacement**: `from domain/application/infrastructure.xxx import yyy`
4. **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High
5. **Resolution Plan**: [Specific steps]
6. **Test Coverage**: [Tests to update]

## üéØ Success Metrics

### By August 10, 2025:
- **Stability**: 14 consecutive days without incidents
- **Performance**: All metrics within 5% of July 27 baseline
- **Dependencies**: 0 cross-dependencies remaining
- **Confidence**: Team unanimously ready for Phase 7

### Documentation Complete:
- [ ] This checklist 100% checked
- [ ] Phase 7 plan updated with findings
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team runbook prepared
