# Phase 7 Progress Summary

## Date: 2025-07-27

### Phase 7.0: Priority WebSocket Fix ✅ COMPLETED
- Updated ws.py to use clean architecture repositories (lines 280-306)
- Rooms created in clean architecture are now visible to WebSocket connections
- Fixed the immediate room visibility issue
- All tests passing

### Phase 7.1: Legacy Code Audit and Marking ✅ COMPLETED
- Ran architecture analysis: 192 legacy files identified (36.9%)
- Created legacy_registry.json with comprehensive tracking
- Marked 7 key legacy files with deprecation headers
- Completed dependency analysis
- Identified safe removal order

### Phase 7.2: Legacy Code Isolation ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- Created legacy quarantine directory structure
- Moved 10 safe files (utility scripts and test files) to quarantine
- **BLOCKED**: Core legacy files cannot be moved due to active dependencies:
  - `socket_manager.py` - used by infrastructure for broadcasting
  - `engine/*.py` - used by enterprise state machine
  - `shared_instances.py` - central to legacy architecture

### Current System Status
- ✅ System fully functional
- ✅ WebSocket connections working
- ✅ Room creation and visibility working
- ✅ Clean architecture handling 100% of traffic via adapters
- ⚠️ Broadcasting still depends on legacy socket_manager
- ⚠️ State machine still imports legacy broadcast

### Files Successfully Quarantined
1. verify_adapter_only_mode_simple.py
2. simple_ws_test.py
3. verify_adapter_only_mode.py
4. fix_dto_inheritance.py
5. run_tests.py
6. start_golden_master_capture.py
7. extract_legacy_handlers.py
8. fix_domain_imports.py
9. run_phase_tests.py
10. analyze_golden_master_mismatches.py

### Critical Dependencies Preventing Full Quarantine

#### socket_manager.py Dependencies:
- infrastructure/events/application_event_publisher.py
- infrastructure/events/websocket_event_publisher.py
- infrastructure/services/websocket_notification_service.py
- engine/state_machine/base_state.py (enterprise!)
- Multiple other infrastructure files

#### Legacy Engine Dependencies:
- State machine imports from engine/
- Legacy bridge still uses AsyncRoomManager

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Option 1: Create Socket Manager Adapter (Recommended)
1. Create `socket_manager_adapter.py` that provides same interface
2. Redirect all imports to use adapter
3. Adapter internally uses clean architecture
4. Then move original to quarantine

#### Option 2: Fix All Imports
1. Update all infrastructure files to remove legacy imports
2. Replace broadcast calls with clean architecture equivalent
3. Update state machine to use clean architecture events
4. Then proceed with quarantine

#### Option 3: Continue Current Approach
1. Continue moving only safe files
2. Leave core legacy files in place
3. Focus on Phase 7.3 validation

### Frontend Validation Status
- ✅ All WebSocket events functioning correctly
- ✅ Room creation, joining, and visibility working
- ✅ No frontend changes required
- ✅ Error handling preserved

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Current partial quarantine approach
- **Medium Risk**: Creating adapter layer
- **High Risk**: Moving core files without fixing dependencies

### Time Estimate
- Phase 7.2 completion: 1-2 additional days to resolve dependencies
- Phase 7.3: 1 day for validation
- Phase 7.4: 1 day for final removal

## Conclusion
Phase 7 is progressing safely but requires resolution of the socket_manager dependency issue before full quarantine can proceed. The system remains stable and functional throughout the process.
