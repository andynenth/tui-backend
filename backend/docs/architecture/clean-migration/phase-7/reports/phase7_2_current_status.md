# Phase 7.2 Current Status Report

## Date: 2025-07-28

### What Was Completed

#### Option 2 Implementation ✅
Successfully implemented Option 2: "Fix All Imports First"
- Created `infrastructure/websocket/broadcast_adapter.py`
- Updated 21 files to use clean architecture broadcasting
- All socket_manager.broadcast imports replaced
- System remains stable and functional

#### Files Successfully Quarantined
After Option 2 completion, moved to `legacy/` directory:
1. `socket_manager.py` - No longer imported anywhere
2. `simple_compatibility_check.py` - Test utility
3. `config/rate_limits.py` - Configuration file
4. `tests/test_reliable_messaging.py` - Legacy test
5. `tests/test_route_replacement.py` - Legacy test

Total: 15 files quarantined (including 10 from earlier)

### Current Blockers

#### New Blocker Discovered: room_manager Dependencies
While attempting to quarantine engine files, discovered:

1. **ws.py has extensive room_manager usage**:
   - 10+ direct calls to room_manager methods
   - Room cleanup task accesses room_manager.rooms dictionary
   - Methods used: get_room(), delete_room(), list_rooms()

2. **shared_instances.py creates circular dependency**:
   - Imports AsyncRoomManager and BotManager
   - Required by multiple infrastructure files
   - Cannot be moved without breaking imports

3. **Engine files have complex interdependencies**:
   - game.py, player.py, piece.py, room.py all import each other
   - State machine depends on these files
   - Cannot be moved as a group without extensive refactoring

### Proposed Solution

Similar to the broadcast adapter approach:

1. **Create room_manager_adapter.py**:
   ```python
   # infrastructure/adapters/room_manager_adapter.py
   from shared_instances import shared_room_manager
   
   async def get_room(room_id: str):
       return await shared_room_manager.get_room(room_id)
   
   async def delete_room(room_id: str):
       return await shared_room_manager.delete_room(room_id)
   
   # etc...
   ```

2. **Update ws.py to use adapter**:
   - Replace all room_manager calls with adapter calls
   - Remove direct shared_instances import

3. **Continue quarantine process**:
   - Move shared_instances.py after adapter in place
   - Move engine files once dependencies resolved

### Current System State
- ✅ Application fully functional
- ✅ Clean architecture handling 100% traffic
- ✅ No socket_manager dependencies remaining
- ⚠️ Room manager dependencies blocking further progress
- ⚠️ 177 legacy files still to quarantine

### Next Steps
1. Implement room_manager_adapter.py
2. Update ws.py to use adapter
3. Continue Phase 7.2 quarantine process
4. Move to Phase 7.3 validation once complete
