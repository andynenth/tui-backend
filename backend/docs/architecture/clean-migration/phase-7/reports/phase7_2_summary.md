# Phase 7.2 Status Report

## Current Situation Analysis

### Dependencies on Legacy Code
After thorough analysis, I've found that moving legacy files to quarantine at this stage would break the system because:

1. **socket_manager.py** is imported by:
   - infrastructure/events/application_event_publisher.py
   - infrastructure/events/websocket_event_publisher.py
   - infrastructure/services/websocket_notification_service.py
   - engine/state_machine/base_state.py (enterprise architecture!)
   - And many other infrastructure files

2. **shared_instances.py** is imported by:
   - socket_manager.py itself
   - api/routes/ws.py (though we've partially fixed this)

### Risk Assessment
Moving these files now would cause immediate system failure due to import errors.

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Create Adapter Layer (Recommended)
Before quarantining legacy files, create adapters that redirect legacy imports to clean architecture:

1. Create `socket_manager_adapter.py` that provides the same interface but uses clean architecture
2. Update imports gradually
3. Then move original files to quarantine

### Option 2: Fix All Imports First
1. Update all infrastructure files to use clean architecture broadcasts
2. Remove all legacy imports
3. Then proceed with quarantine

### Option 3: Partial Quarantine (Current Capability)
Only quarantine files with no active dependencies:
- Test files that test legacy components
- Utility scripts
- Documentation files

## Current Clean Architecture Status
- ✅ WebSocket connections use clean architecture repositories (Phase 7.0)
- ✅ Room management through adapters (100% traffic)
- ✅ Game logic through adapters
- ⚠️  Broadcasting still uses legacy socket_manager
- ⚠️  State machine uses legacy broadcast

## Next Steps Decision Required

Should we:
1. Create adapter layer for socket_manager first?
2. Fix all imports to use clean architecture?
3. Proceed with partial quarantine of safe files only?

The system is currently stable and functional. Any quarantine action must preserve this stability.
