# Phase Implementation Roadmap - Detailed Technical Specifications

## Overview
Implementation of WAITING and TURN_RESULTS phases to match frontend behavior and eliminate phase synchronization issues.

**Current Status: Phase 1 - WAITING Implementation**

### Problem Statement
- Frontend expects 7 phases: waiting, preparation, declaration, turn, turn_results, scoring, game_over
- Backend supports 5 phases: preparation, declaration, turn, scoring, game_over
- Missing WAITING and TURN_RESULTS phases cause sync issues and poor UX

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### Current State (BEFORE Implementation)

**Phase Flow Issues:**
```
Frontend: waiting → preparation → declaration → turn → turn_results → scoring → game_over
Backend:           preparation → declaration → turn              → scoring → game_over
          ↑                                        ↑
      MISSING                                  MISSING
```

**Current Problems:**
1. **Phase Mismatch**: Frontend shows `waiting` phase but backend has no support
2. **Missing Turn Results**: Turn completion jumps directly to scoring/next turn
3. **Poor UX**: No visual feedback during turn result display period
4. **Sync Issues**: Frontend expects events backend doesn't send
5. **Connection Confusion**: Room setup appears broken due to missing waiting phase

**Current Backend Flow:**
1. **Room Creation**: `Room.started = False` but no phase management
2. **Game Start**: Direct transition from room to `PREPARATION` phase
3. **Turn Completion**: `turn_complete` event → 7sec delay → next phase (no visual feedback)
4. **WebSocket Events**: `room_update`, `game_started` but no standardized `phase_change` during waiting

**Current Frontend Behavior:**
1. **Waiting Phase**: Shows connection status but receives no backend support
2. **Turn Results**: Displays correctly but backend doesn't coordinate timing
3. **Phase Routing**: GameContainer handles all 7 phases but 2 are unsupported

### Target State (AFTER Implementation)

**Complete Phase Flow:**
```
Frontend: waiting → preparation → declaration → turn → turn_results → scoring → game_over
Backend:  waiting → preparation → declaration → turn → turn_results → scoring → game_over
           ↑                                        ↑
      SUPPORTED                               SUPPORTED
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
1. **Perfect Sync**: Frontend and backend phases completely aligned
2. **Enhanced UX**: Proper waiting lobby and turn result display
3. **Enterprise Architecture**: All phases use automatic broadcasting
4. **Better Error Handling**: Connection status during waiting phase
5. **Improved Game Flow**: Visual feedback for every game state

**New Backend Flow:**
1. **Room Creation**: Enters `WAITING` phase with proper state management
2. **Player Management**: Track connections, readiness, room capacity
3. **Game Start**: Validated transition from `WAITING` → `PREPARATION`
4. **Turn Results**: Dedicated phase for result display with auto-progression
5. **WebSocket Events**: Standardized `phase_change` events for all phases

**Enhanced Frontend Experience:**
1. **Waiting Phase**: Full backend support with real-time room updates
2. **Turn Results**: Synchronized display timing with backend
3. **Phase Management**: All 7 phases properly coordinated

## Phase 1: WAITING State Implementation

### Tasks Breakdown
1. ✅ **Create roadmap file** - Track implementation progress
2. ⏳ **Add WAITING enum** - Add to GamePhase enum in core.py
3. ⏳ **Create WaitingState** - Enterprise architecture state class
4. ⏳ **Connection management** - Track player connections and readiness
5. ⏳ **Update state machine** - Add WAITING to states and transitions
6. ⏳ **Room capacity logic** - Validate 4 players before game start
7. ⏳ **Test WAITING phase** - End-to-end validation

### Frontend WAITING Behavior Analysis

**Entry Conditions:**
- Game room created or reset
- Players joining game lobby via WebSocket connection
- Initial page load to game room

**Data Flow & WebSocket Events:**
- **Expected Props Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface WaitingUIProps {
    isConnected: boolean;
    isConnecting?: boolean;
    isReconnecting?: boolean;
    connectionError?: string;
    message?: string;
    phase?: 'waiting' | 'preparation' | 'declaration' | 'turn' | 'scoring';
    onRetry?: () => void;
    onCancel?: () => void;
  }
  ```

- **WebSocket Events Expected**:
  - `connected` - Successful room connection establishment
  - `disconnected` - Connection lost or intentional disconnect
  - `room_state_update` - Room composition changes (players joining/leaving)
  - `game_started` - Transition from waiting to preparation phase
  - `error` - Connection or room-related errors

- **Room State Data Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "room_id": "room_123",
    "host_name": "Player1",
    "started": false,
    "slots": {
      "P1": {"name": "Player1", "is_bot": false, "is_host": true},
      "P2": {"name": "Bot 2", "is_bot": true, "is_host": false},
      "P3": {"name": "Player2", "is_bot": false, "is_host": false},
      "P4": null
    },
    "players": [...],
    "occupied_slots": 3,
    "total_slots": 4
  }
  ```

**User Actions:**
- onRetry() - Connection recovery after errors
- onCancel() - Return to lobby/exit room

**Exit Conditions:**
- Host triggers `start_game` event via WebSocket
- Backend validates 4 players connected
- Backend creates Game + StateMachine instances
- Backend sends `game_started` → `phase_change(preparation)`

**Critical Backend Requirements:**
- Send `phase_change` events with `phase: "waiting"` during room setup
- Include standardized player data format matching game phases
- Handle room composition changes with real-time updates
- Validate 4-player requirement before allowing game start
- Maintain connection status tracking per player

### Current Backend Integration Points

**Room Management (`backend/engine/room.py`)**:
- `Room.started = False` maps to frontend waiting phase
- `join_room_safe()`, `assign_slot_safe()` affect room state
- `start_game_safe()` transitions from waiting to preparation

**WebSocket Events (`backend/api/routes/ws.py`)**:
- Currently sends `room_state_update` and `room_update` events
- Missing: `phase_change` events for waiting phase
- Missing: Standardized player data format

### Implementation Strategy - Verified Code References

**WaitingState Class** (Following existing patterns):
- Extend `GameState` base class (`backend/engine/state_machine/base_state.py:10-254`)
- Use enterprise `update_phase_data()` method (`base_state.py:80-119`) for automatic broadcasting
- Implement `broadcast_custom_event()` (`base_state.py:221-254`) for custom events
- Follow pattern from `PreparationState` (`backend/engine/state_machine/states/preparation_state.py`)

**Room Integration** (Verified existing methods):
- Use `Room.started = False` flag (`backend/engine/room.py:16-44`) to detect waiting phase
- Hook into `join_room_safe()` (`room.py:100-156`) for player tracking
- Hook into `start_game_safe()` (`room.py:158-210`) for transition trigger
- Use existing asyncio locks (`room.py:31-36`) for thread safety

**State Machine Integration** (Verified existing structure):
- Add to `states` dict (`backend/engine/state_machine/game_state_machine.py:38-44`)
- Update `_valid_transitions` map (`game_state_machine.py:47-53`)
- Use existing `_transition_to()` method (`game_state_machine.py:143-179`)
- Use existing `broadcast_event()` (`game_state_machine.py:247-250`) for WebSocket events

## Phase 2: TURN_RESULTS State Implementation

### Tasks Breakdown
1. ⏳ **Add TURN_RESULTS enum** - Add to GamePhase enum
2. ⏳ **Create TurnResultsState** - State for displaying turn outcomes
3. ⏳ **Turn result data** - Winner, pile awards, turn summary structure
4. ⏳ **Auto-transition timer** - Automatic progression after display period
5. ⏳ **Update transitions** - TURN → TURN_RESULTS → (SCORING|next TURN)
6. ⏳ **Test TURN_RESULTS** - End-to-end validation

### Frontend TURN_RESULTS Behavior Analysis

**Entry Conditions:**
- Turn completed with winner determined in backend TurnState
- Backend sends `turn_complete` event
- GameService transitions to `turn_results` phase automatically

**Data Flow & Expected Props** (Verified implementation):
- **GameContainer Props Mapping** (`frontend/src/components/game/GameContainer.jsx:106-130`):
  ```javascript
  const turnResultsProps = useMemo(() => ({
    winner: gameState.turnWinner || null,
    winningPlay: gameState.winningPlay || null,
    playerPiles: gameState.playerPiles || {},
    players: gameState.players || [],
    turnNumber: gameState.turnNumber || 1,
    nextStarter: gameState.nextStarter || null
  }), [gameState, gameActions]);
  ```

- **Verified TurnResultsUI PropTypes** (`TurnResultsUI.jsx:236-257`):
  - `winner: PropTypes.string`
  - `winningPlay: PropTypes.shape({pieces, value, type, pilesWon})`
  - `playerPiles: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number)`
  - `players: PropTypes.arrayOf(...).isRequired`
  - `turnNumber: PropTypes.number`
  - `nextStarter: PropTypes.string`

- **Required Data Structure from Backend**:
  ```json
  {
    "winner": "PlayerName" | null,
    "winning_play": {
      "pieces": ["PIECE_STR", ...],
      "value": 15,
      "type": "PAIR",
      "pilesWon": 3
    } | null,
    "player_piles": {
      "PlayerName": 3,    // Piles won THIS turn only (0 for non-winners)
      "OtherPlayer": 0
    },
    "players": [{"name": "PlayerName"}, ...],
    "turn_number": 5,
    "next_starter": "PlayerName" | null,
    "all_hands_empty": false,
    "will_continue": true
  }
  ```

**User Actions:**
- None - completely passive/display-only phase
- No user input required or accepted

**Exit Conditions:**
- Auto-timer expires (7 seconds display time)
- Backend determines next phase based on game state:
  - If `all_hands_empty`: transition to SCORING phase
  - If hands remain: transition back to TURN phase (next turn)

**Critical Data Requirements:**
- `player_piles` must show piles won **this turn only**, not accumulated totals
- `winning_play.pilesWon` must equal `required_piece_count` from turn
- `all_hands_empty` determines scoring vs. continue turns
- Exact timing coordination with backend (7-second display period)

### Current Backend Integration Points - Verified Implementation

**Turn Completion** (`backend/engine/state_machine/states/turn_state.py`):
- **Verified `_broadcast_turn_completion_enterprise()`** (`turn_state.py:756-816`): Broadcasts `turn_complete` with correct data
- **Verified `_process_turn_completion()`** (`turn_state.py:494-566`): Handles complete turn processing
- **Verified `start_next_turn_if_needed()`** (`turn_state.py:124-151`): Manages turn progression
- **Current data format matches frontend exactly** (verified against `TurnResultsUI.jsx:236-257`)

**Verified Transition Logic**:
1. `_complete_turn()` → `_process_turn_completion()` → `_broadcast_turn_completion_enterprise()`
2. 7-second delay via `asyncio.sleep(7.0)` in `_process_turn_completion()`
3. `all_hands_empty` check determines next phase:
   - If true: Uses existing `check_transition_conditions()` → SCORING
   - If false: Uses `start_next_turn_if_needed()` → next TURN

### Implementation Strategy - Option B (RECOMMENDED)

**Why Option B (Minimal Changes)**:
- Frontend already handles `turn_results` phase perfectly
- Existing `turn_complete` event data matches UI requirements exactly
- Backend timing logic (7-second delay) already implemented
- Minimal risk - reuses tested enterprise architecture

**Required Changes**:
1. **Modify `_process_turn_completion()`** to broadcast `phase_change` to `turn_results`
2. **Add 7-second display period** with `phase_change` back to `turn`/`scoring`
3. **Ensure data consistency** between `turn_complete` and `phase_change` events
4. **Preserve existing timing logic** and enterprise patterns

**Implementation Flow**:
```
Turn completes → phase_change(turn_results) → 7 sec delay → phase_change(turn|scoring)
```

**Code Changes** (Verified existing methods):
- Modify `TurnState._process_turn_completion()` (`backend/engine/state_machine/states/turn_state.py:494-566`) 
- Enhance existing `_broadcast_turn_completion_enterprise()` (`turn_state.py:756-816`)
- Use existing `start_next_turn_if_needed()` (`turn_state.py:124-151`) for progression
- Maintain existing enterprise `update_phase_data()` pattern (`turn_state.py:193-201, 312-318`)
- Preserve existing 7-second delay logic for turn display

## Key Concerns & Mitigations

### 1. State Machine Complexity
**Concern:** Adding intermediate phases increases transition complexity
**Mitigation:** 
- Follow existing enterprise patterns exactly
- Comprehensive transition validation and testing
- Unit tests for each new transition path
- Preserve existing game logic without modification

### 2. Timing Coordination  
**Concern:** Frontend/backend must sync on phase duration and transitions
**Mitigation:**
- Backend controls all timing (frontend is passive receiver)
- Use existing 7-second timer logic from TurnState
- Configurable timer durations for flexibility
- Enterprise auto-broadcasting ensures sync

### 3. Error Handling
**Concern:** Connection drops during intermediate phases
**Mitigation:**
- Robust reconnection logic via existing WebSocket layer
- Phase state recovery using enterprise event sourcing
- Fallback to stable phases (PREPARATION, TURN, SCORING)
- Connection status tracking in WaitingState

### 4. Data Structure Consistency
**Concern:** New phases might break existing data formats
**Mitigation:**
- Reuse existing data structures exactly (especially for turn_results)
- Validate JSON serialization compatibility
- Test with existing frontend components
- No changes to player, game, or scoring data formats

### 5. Game Logic Validation
**Concern:** New transitions might introduce game flow bugs
**Mitigation:**
- Preserve all existing game logic in core states
- WAITING and TURN_RESULTS are display/management phases only
- Test complete game scenarios end-to-end
