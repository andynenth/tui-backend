# Get Room State Fix Summary

## Problem
The `get_room_state` use case was failing with:
```
AttributeError: 'Room' object has no attribute 'host_id'
```

This prevented the frontend from receiving room state, causing it to display "Waiting..." for all player slots.

## Root Cause
The `get_room_state.py` file was written for a different domain model than what actually exists:

### Expected vs Actual Domain Model

| Expected (Wrong) | Actual (Correct) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `room.id` | `room.room_id` |
| `room.host_id` | `room.host_name` |
| `room.code` | `room.room_id` (used as code) |
| `room.name` | Generated from `host_name` |
| `room.settings.*` | Not present in domain |
| `room.created_at` | Not tracked |
| `room.current_game` | `room.game` |
| `slot.id` | Not present - generated as `room_id_p{index}` |
| `player.id` | Not present - use name or generate |
| `game.id` | `game.game_id` |

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Player Info Generation
```python
# Before (WRONG):
player_id=slot.id,
is_host=slot.id == room.host_id,

# After (CORRECT):
player_id=f"{room.room_id}_p{i}",  # Generate player ID
is_host=slot.name == room.host_name,  # Compare names
```

### 2. Room Info Generation
```python
# Before (WRONG):
room_id=room.id,
room_code=room.code,
host_id=room.host_id,
max_players=room.settings.max_players,

# After (CORRECT):
room_id=room.room_id,
room_code=room.room_id,  # Using room_id as code
host_id=f"{room.room_id}_p0",  # Host is always first player
max_players=room.max_slots,
```

### 3. Game State Serialization
```python
# Before (WRONG):
"game_id": game.id,
"scores": {p.id: p.score for p in game.players},

# After (CORRECT):
"game_id": game.game_id if hasattr(game, 'game_id') else f"{room.room_id}_game",
"scores": {f"{room.room_id}_p{i}": p.score for i, p in enumerate(game.players)},
```

### 4. Player Name Lookup
```python
# Before (WRONG):
if slot and slot.id == player_id:
    return slot.name

# After (CORRECT):
# Extract player index from ID format: room_id_p0, room_id_p1, etc.
player_index = int(player_id.split('_p')[1])
slot = room.slots[player_index]
return slot.name if slot else None
```

## Result
After these fixes:
1. `get_room_state` no longer throws AttributeError
2. Room state is successfully sent to the frontend
3. Frontend receives proper player data with correct property names
4. Players and bots should now be displayed instead of "Waiting..."

## Combined with Previous Fix
This fix works together with the previous property name fix:
- Backend now sends `name` instead of `player_name`
- Backend generates consistent player IDs
- Frontend receives complete room state with all players
