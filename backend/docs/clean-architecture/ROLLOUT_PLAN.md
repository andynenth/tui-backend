# Clean Architecture Rollout Plan

## Executive Summary

This document serves as a historical record of the production rollout strategy that was used to successfully migrate from the legacy WebSocket-based architecture to clean architecture. The migration was **COMPLETED** on 2025-07-28.

**Actual Timeline**: Successfully completed across all phases  
**Risk Level**: Managed successfully with zero incidents  
**Downtime**: Zero - no service interruption during migration  

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Production Validation (Week 0)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Clean architecture implemented
- [x] Feature flags integrated
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Performance benchmarks established

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment (Week 1)
**Goal**: Validate in staging environment

**Actions**:
1. Deploy clean architecture code to staging
2. Enable shadow mode for all components
3. Run automated test suites
4. Perform load testing
5. Monitor for 72 hours

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero discrepancies between implementations
- Performance within 5% of baseline
- All integration tests passing

**Rollback Trigger**:
- Any data inconsistency
- Performance degradation > 10%
- Critical bugs discovered

### Phase 2: Internal Beta (Week 2)
**Goal**: Test with internal users

**Actions**:
1. Enable clean architecture for internal team (5-10 users)
2. Use list-based feature flags:
   ```python
   {
     "use_clean_architecture": {
       "enabled": true,
       "whitelist": ["dev_user_1", "dev_user_2", ...]
     }
   }
   ```
3. Collect feedback
4. Monitor metrics closely

**Success Criteria**:
- Positive feedback from internal users
- No blocking issues reported
- Metrics remain stable

### Phase 3: Connection Layer Rollout (Week 3)
**Goal**: Migrate low-risk connection operations

**10% Rollout** (Day 1-2):
```python
{
  "use_connection_adapters": {
    "enabled": true,
    "percentage": 10
  }
}
```

**50% Rollout** (Day 3-4):
```python
{
  "use_connection_adapters": {
    "enabled": true,
    "percentage": 50
  }
}
```

**100% Rollout** (Day 5-7):
```python
{
  "use_connection_adapters": {
    "enabled": true,
    "percentage": 100
  }
}
```

**Operations Affected**:
- ping/pong
- client_ready
- sync_state

**Monitoring**:
- Connection stability
- Latency metrics
- Error rates

### Phase 4: Room Management Rollout (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Migrate room operations

**Staged Rollout**:
- Day 1-3: 10% of users

- Day 7-10: 100% of users

**Operations Affected**:
- create_room
- join_room
- leave_room
- add_bot
- kick_player

**Special Considerations**:
- Peak hours avoidance (deploy during low traffic)
- Extra monitoring for concurrent operations
- Database transaction monitoring

### Phase 5: Game Operations Rollout (Week 6-7)
**Goal**: Migrate critical game logic

**Conservative Rollout**:
- Week 6, Day 1-3: 5% of users
- Week 6, Day 4-7: 20% of users
- Week 7, Day 1-3: 50% of users
- Week 7, Day 4-7: 100% of users

**Operations Affected**:
- start_game
- declare
- play
- end_game
- scoring

**Extra Precautions**:
- Dedicated on-call rotation
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Automated rollback on anomalies

### Phase 6: Cleanup (Week 8)
**Goal**: Remove legacy code

**Actions**:
1. Verify all feature flags at 100%
2. Run full regression suite
3. Remove legacy code in stages:
   - Day 1-2: Remove unused imports
   - Day 3-4: Remove legacy handlers
   - Day 5-6: Remove legacy managers
   - Day 7: Final cleanup
4. Update all documentation
5. Archive legacy code branch

    threshold: error_rate > 1%
    action: immediate_rollback
    
  - name: data_inconsistency
    threshold: shadow_mode_mismatch > 0
    action: pause_rollout

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 minute)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback script

# Disable all feature flags
curl -X POST https://api.config.service/flags \
  -d '{
    "use_clean_architecture": false,
    "use_connection_adapters": false,
    "use_room_adapters": false,
    "use_game_adapters": false
  }'

# Verify rollback
curl https://api.health/status

# Notify team
./notify_rollback.sh "Emergency rollback executed"
```

### Gradual Rollback
For non-critical issues:
1. Reduce percentage gradually (100% → 50% → 10% → 0%)
2. Monitor metrics at each stage
3. Investigate root cause
4. Fix issues before re-attempting
