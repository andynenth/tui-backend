# Documentation Overlap Resolution Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Integration Line Count Discrepancy ✅
- **Problem**: Documents showed 3, 10, or 15 lines for ws.py integration
- **Reality**: Actual integration is 12 lines (8-9 code + comments)
- **Fixed**: All documents now show consistent, accurate numbers

### 2. Duplicate Status Information ✅
- **Problem**: README and PHASE_1_FINAL_STATUS had identical metrics
- **Solution**: README now brief with link to detailed status
- **Result**: Single source of truth for status information

### 3. Misplaced Next Steps ✅
- **Problem**: Status document included deployment steps
- **Solution**: Moved deployment info to runbook, added cross-references
- **Result**: Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Missing Document Purpose ✅
- **Problem**: Unclear which document to use for what
- **Solution**: Added "Purpose" and "See Also" sections
- **Result**: Clear navigation and usage guidance

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistency**: All line counts now match reality (12 lines)
2. **Clarity**: Each document has a clear, stated purpose
3. **Navigation**: Cross-references guide users to related info
4. **No Duplication**: Status info in one place, referenced elsewhere

## Document Roles Now Clear

- **README.md**: Navigation hub, brief status
- **PHASE_1_FINAL_STATUS.md**: Authoritative metrics and decisions
- **WS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Technical integration steps
- **ADAPTER_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md**: Deployment procedures
