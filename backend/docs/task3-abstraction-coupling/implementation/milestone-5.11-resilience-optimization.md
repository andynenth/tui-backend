## Usage Examples

### Circuit Breaker
```python
from backend.infrastructure.resilience import CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerConfig

# Configure circuit breaker
config = CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=5,
    recovery_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
    half_open_max_calls=3
)

# Create circuit breaker
cb = CircuitBreaker("external-api", config)

# Use with protection
try:
    result = await cb.call_async(external_api_call)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle circuit open or call failure
    pass
```

### Retry with Backoff
```python
from backend.infrastructure.resilience import retry, RetryStrategy

@retry(
    max_attempts=5,
    initial_delay=1.0,
    strategy=RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL
)
async def flaky_operation():
    # Operation that may fail transiently
    pass
```

### Connection Pooling
```python
from backend.infrastructure.resilience import ConnectionPool, ConnectionPoolConfig

# Configure pool
config = ConnectionPoolConfig(
    min_size=5,
    max_size=20,
    max_overflow=10,
    idle_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
)

# Create pool with factory
pool = ConnectionPool(db_connection_factory, config)

# Use connections
async with pool.connection() as conn:
    # Use connection
    pass
```

### Load Shedding
```python
from backend.infrastructure.resilience import load_shed

@load_shed(priority=2, client_id_getter=lambda req: req.client_id)
async def handle_request(request):
    # Request will be shed under high load
    pass
```

### Health Checks
```python
from backend.infrastructure.health import (
    register_health_check,
    HTTPHealthCheck,
    check_health
)

# Register health checks
register_health_check(
    HTTPHealthCheck(
        "api-service",
        "http://api.example.com/health",
        expected_status=200
    )
)

# Check health
health_status = await check_health()
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Optimization
- Object pooling reduces allocation overhead
- Memory tracking identifies leaks
- GC tuning improves performance
- Memory limits prevent exhaustion

### Connection Management
- Connection pooling reduces overhead
- Health checking maintains pool quality
- Overflow handling manages bursts
- Idle timeout prevents resource waste

### Load Management
- Adaptive shedding prevents overload
- Priority-based shedding protects critical operations
- Fair queuing prevents client starvation
- Real-time metrics enable quick response

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collected
- Circuit breaker state changes and failure rates
- Retry attempts and success rates
- Bulkhead utilization and rejections
- Connection pool statistics
- Memory usage and allocations
- Performance hotspots
- Health check results

### Integration Points
- Metrics can be exported to Prometheus

- Performance reports for analysis

## Testing

Comprehensive chaos engineering tests validate:
- System behavior under failures
- Recovery mechanisms
- Resource limits enforcement
- Concurrent operation handling
- Integration of multiple patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Use for external service calls
2. **Retry**: Apply to transient failures only
3. **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources
4. **Timeout**: Set appropriate limits for operations
5. **Connection Pool**: Size based on load patterns
6. **Load Shedding**: Configure thresholds carefully
7. **Health Checks**: Monitor all critical components

## Migration Guide

To integrate resilience patterns:

1. Identify failure points in your system
2. Choose appropriate patterns for each
3. Configure based on your requirements
4. Add monitoring and alerting
5. Test under failure conditions
6. Tune based on production metrics
