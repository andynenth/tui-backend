1. **Connection Management** - Full lifecycle with state tracking
2. **Real-time Broadcasting** - Automatic updates on data changes
3. **Event System** - Priority queuing and batch processing
4. **Middleware Stack** - Auth, rate limiting, observability, error handling
5. **State Synchronization** - Multiple strategies with conflict resolution
6. **Recovery System** - Reconnection with state recovery
7. **Subscription Management** - Targeted updates with filtering

### Integration Points
- Repositories automatically broadcast changes

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing Milestone 5.8: State Machine Persistence
- Integrate WebSocket infrastructure with game handlers

- Overall Phase 5: 83/234 items - 35.5% complete

### Key Achievements
1. Revised Phase 5 plan to align with Database Readiness Report
2. Implemented high-performance in-memory repositories
3. Created comprehensive test suite with performance verification
4. Completed 8 out of 12 infrastructure milestones in a single day
5. Built production-ready state persistence with multiple strategies
6. Established complete observability and monitoring foundation
7. Created WebSocket infrastructure with real-time capabilities

### Design Philosophy Established
Based on the Database Integration Readiness Report findings:
- **Memory First**: Zero-latency operations for active games
- **Archive Later**: Async persistence only for completed games  
- **Future Ready**: Abstractions support database when needed
- **No Performance Impact**: Maintains bot timing (0.5-1.5s)

### Resource Needs
- [x] Clarification on database integration approach (resolved)
- [ ] Archive backend selection (S3, PostgreSQL, or filesystem)
- [ ] Performance baseline measurements from current system
