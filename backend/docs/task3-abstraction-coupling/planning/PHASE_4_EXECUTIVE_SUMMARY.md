# Phase 4: Application Layer - Executive Summary

**Status**: 📋 AWAITING APPROVAL  
**Prerequisite**: Phase 3 Domain Layer ✅ COMPLETE (162 tests passing)  
**Scope**: Create use cases to orchestrate domain logic  
**Risk**: LOW (all changes behind existing adapters)  

## Quick Overview

Phase 4 introduces the **application layer** - use cases that orchestrate the domain entities and services created in Phase 3. This layer handles workflows, transaction boundaries, and cross-cutting concerns while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## What Gets Built

### 22 Use Cases (matching the 22 adapters)
```
Connection (4): HandlePing, MarkClientReady, AcknowledgeMessage, SyncClientState
Room Mgmt (6): CreateRoom, JoinRoom, LeaveRoom, GetRoomState, AddBot, RemovePlayer  
Lobby (2): GetRoomList, GetRoomDetails
Game (10): StartGame, Declare, Play, Redeal flows, Ready, LeaveGame
```

### 4 Application Services
- `GameApplicationService` - High-level game operations
- `RoomApplicationService` - Room lifecycle management
- `LobbyApplicationService` - Room discovery  
- `ConnectionApplicationService` - Client connections

## Key Design Decisions

1. **One Use Case = One Transaction**
   - Clear boundaries for atomic operations
   - Explicit rollback handling

2. **Use Cases Orchestrate, Don't Implement**
   - Business logic stays in domain
   - Use cases coordinate domain objects
   - No business rules in application layer

3. **Feature Flag Per Use Case**
   - Granular control over rollout
   - Instant rollback capability
   - A/B testing built-in

4. **Zero Frontend Impact**
   - All changes behind Phase 1 adapters
   - WebSocket contracts unchanged
   - Shadow mode validates behavior

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1 Schedule
- **Day 1**: Setup + Connection use cases (4)
- **Day 2**: Room management use cases (6)  
- **Day 3**: Lobby + basic game use cases (5)
- **Day 4**: Complex game use cases (7) + services
- **Day 5**: Integration, testing, documentation

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: ~150 tests for use cases and services
- **Integration Tests**: Adapter-to-use-case flows
- **Contract Tests**: Verify WebSocket compatibility
- **Shadow Mode**: Compare old vs new paths

## Success Metrics

✅ **Compatibility**: 100% WebSocket contract adherence  
✅ **Performance**: <60% overhead (baseline: 44%)  
✅ **Testing**: All tests passing (unit, integration, contract)  
✅ **Rollback**: <1 second via feature flags  

## What's NOT Included

❌ Repository implementations (Phase 5)  
❌ Infrastructure services (Phase 5)  
❌ State machine refactoring  
❌ Bot strategy extraction  
❌ Any WebSocket protocol changes  

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Performance regression | Profile each use case, optimize hot paths |
| Complex orchestration | Start simple, incrementally add complexity |
| State inconsistency | Event sourcing provides audit trail |
| Integration bugs | Extensive integration testing |

## Approval Checklist

Before approving Phase 4 implementation:

- [ ] Review detailed plan in `PHASE_4_APPLICATION_LAYER.md`
- [ ] Confirm use case scope aligns with business needs
- [ ] Verify testing strategy is comprehensive
- [ ] Approve 4-day implementation timeline
- [ ] Confirm rollback strategy is acceptable

## Next Steps

Upon approval:
1. Create application layer structure
2. Implement use cases in priority order
3. Integrate with existing adapters
4. Run comprehensive test suite
5. Document patterns and decisions

---

**Recommendation**: Phase 4 is low-risk due to the adapter isolation from Phase 1. The application layer provides clean orchestration of the domain without requiring any frontend changes. The incremental approach with feature flags ensures safe rollout.
