## Testing Strategy Overview

### Testing Principles
1. **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal system tests
2. **Test Isolation**: Infrastructure tests should not depend on external services
3. **Performance Baselines**: Establish benchmarks before optimization
4. **Failure Scenarios**: Test error conditions and recovery mechanisms
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing interfaces
