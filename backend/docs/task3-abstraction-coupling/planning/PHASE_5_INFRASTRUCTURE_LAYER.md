## 1. Overview & Objective

### Role of the Infrastructure Layer
The Infrastructure Layer provides concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the Application Layer while managing all cross-cutting concerns:
- **In-Memory Persistence**: Repository implementations that maintain current performance characteristics
- **Hybrid Storage Strategy**: Event store for completed games only (no impact on active gameplay)
- **External Integrations**: WebSocket handlers, HTTP middleware, monitoring systems
- **System Observability**: Logging, metrics, monitoring without adding latency
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling, caching, rate limiting
- **Technical Policies**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, timeouts

### Important Context from Database Readiness Report
The system is optimized for in-memory, real-time multiplayer gaming. Direct database integration would require significant refactoring and could impact performance. This phase implements a **hybrid approach**:
- Active games remain in memory for optimal performance
- Completed games are asynchronously persisted for analytics
- Infrastructure patterns prepare for future database integration if needed

### Architectural Boundaries
- **Depends on**: Application and Domain layers (implements their interfaces)
- **Does not depend on**: Presentation layer or frontend
- **Provides**: Concrete implementations with in-memory performance
- **Isolation**: Domain entities never reference infrastructure code

## 2. Scope Definition

### What Will Be Included
- **In-Memory Repository Implementations**: High-performance repositories maintaining current speed
- **Hybrid Event Store**: Async persistence for completed games only
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Adapters and broadcasting optimizations
- **Group 2 Features** (from Phase 4.11): Rate limiting, health monitoring, logging, metrics
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Caching, error handling, resilience patterns
- **Production Features**: Observability without performance impact

### What Will Not Be Included
- Direct database integration for active games
- Synchronous persistence operations
- Changes that impact real-time performance
- Frontend modifications
- API contract changes

### Key Design Constraint
Per the Database Readiness Report, we must maintain:
- Bot response times (0.5-1.5s)
- Instant state access for game operations
- Zero-latency WebSocket broadcasting
- Current performance characteristics

### Dependencies on Previous Phases
- Phase 1: WebSocket adapter interfaces
- Phase 2: Domain event definitions
- Phase 3: Application layer interfaces
- Phase 4: Use case implementations
