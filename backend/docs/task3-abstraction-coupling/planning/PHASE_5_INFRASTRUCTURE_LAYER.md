# Phase 5: Infrastructure Layer Implementation Plan

## 1. Phase Overview

### Role of the Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer serves as the foundation of our clean architecture, providing concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the Application Layer while managing all cross-cutting concerns. This layer handles:

- External system integrations (databases, message queues, external APIs)
- Framework-specific implementations (WebSocket handlers, HTTP middleware)
- System observability (logging, metrics, monitoring)
- Resource management (connection pooling, caching, rate limiting)
- Technical policies (retry logic, circuit breakers, timeouts)

### Why This Is the Most Complex Phase

Phase 5 represents the culmination of our architectural transformation, requiring:

1. **Multiple Integration Points**: Connecting to WebSockets, databases, event stores, and monitoring systems
2. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Implementing aspects that affect all layers without violating boundaries
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the clean architecture doesn't introduce latency
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining exact behavior for the existing frontend
5. **Production Readiness**: Adding enterprise features deferred from earlier phases

### Architectural Boundaries

The Infrastructure Layer must respect these boundaries:
- **Depends on**: Application and Domain layers (implements their interfaces)
- **Does not depend on**: Presentation layer or frontend
- **Provides to Application Layer**: Concrete implementations of repositories, event publishers, and external services
- **Isolated from Domain**: Domain entities never reference infrastructure code

## 4. Interaction Contracts

### Adapter Pattern
All infrastructure components will use the Adapter pattern to implement application interfaces:

```python
# Application Interface
class EventPublisher(ABC):
    async def publish(self, event: DomainEvent) -> None: ...

# Infrastructure Implementation
class WebSocketEventPublisher(EventPublisher):
    async def publish(self, event: DomainEvent) -> None:
        # Convert to WebSocket message
        # Broadcast to appropriate rooms
```

### Repository Pattern
Repositories will provide both synchronous and asynchronous operations:

```python
class SqlGameRepository(GameRepository):
    async def get_by_id(self, game_id: str) -> Optional[Game]:
        # SQL query with connection pooling
        # Entity hydration
        # Cache management
```

### Event Sourcing Pattern
Event store will support replay and projection:

```python
class EventStore:
    async def append(self, stream_id: str, events: List[Event]) -> None
    async def get_events(self, stream_id: str, from_version: int) -> List[Event]
    async def get_snapshot(self, stream_id: str) -> Optional[Snapshot]
```

### Middleware Stack Pattern
Request processing pipeline with composable middleware:

```python
class MiddlewarePipeline:
    def use(self, middleware: Middleware) -> None
    async def execute(self, context: RequestContext) -> Response
```

## 5. Risks and Design Considerations

### Failure Points
1. **Database Connection Loss**
   - Risk: Game state corruption
   - Mitigation: Implement connection retry with exponential backoff
   - Fallback: In-memory cache for critical operations

2. **Event Store Overflow**
   - Risk: Memory exhaustion from event accumulation
   - Mitigation: Implement event compaction and archiving
   - Monitoring: Alert on event count thresholds

3. **WebSocket Broadcast Storms**
   - Risk: Server overload from mass disconnections
   - Mitigation: Rate limit broadcasts, implement backpressure
   - Recovery: Gradual reconnection with jitter

4. **Cache Inconsistency**
   - Risk: Stale data serving
   - Mitigation: Cache invalidation on writes, TTL policies
   - Verification: Cache hit/miss metrics

### Observability Strategy
1. **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration
2. **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: Grafana for real-time monitoring
4. **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for production

### Performance Considerations
1. **Connection Pooling**: Prevent connection exhaustion
2. **Batch Operations**: Reduce database round trips
3. **Async I/O**: Non-blocking operations throughout
4. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory, Redis)
