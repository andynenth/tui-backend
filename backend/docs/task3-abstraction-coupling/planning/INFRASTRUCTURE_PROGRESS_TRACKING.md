## Reporting Tools Integration

### Automated Progress Tracking
```python
# Script to generate progress report from checklist
import re
from pathlib import Path

def calculate_progress():
    checklist = Path("PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md").read_text()
    total = len(re.findall(r"- \[ \]", checklist))
    completed = len(re.findall(r"- \[x\]", checklist))
    
    return {
        "total": total,
        "completed": completed,
        "percentage": round(completed / total * 100, 2)
    }

# Run weekly to update status
```

### Milestone Burndown Chart
Track daily progress for each milestone:

```markdown
## Milestone 5.X Burndown

| Date | Remaining Items | Completed Today | Blockers |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Day 1 | 20 | 0 | None |
| Day 2 | 18 | 2 | None |
| Day 3 | 15 | 3 | Redis setup |
| Day 4 | 15 | 0 | Redis setup |
| Day 5 | 12 | 3 | None |
```

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup Format (if working in team)
```markdown
## [Date] Daily Standup - [Your Name]

### Yesterday
- Completed: [What was finished]
- Progress on: [What was worked on]

### Today
- Focus: [Main task for today]
- Goal: [Specific deliverable]

### Blockers
- [Any blocking issues]
- Need help with: [Specific assistance needed]
```

### Escalation Path
1. **Technical Blocker**: Document in daily log → Attempt resolution → Escalate after 4 hours
2. **Dependency Blocker**: Document immediately → Update risk register → Escalate immediately
3. **Performance Issue**: Document metrics → Investigate root cause → Escalate if target missed by >50%
4. **Resource Need**: Document in weekly summary → Escalate by end of week

## Quality Gates

Each milestone must pass these quality gates before moving to the next:

### Gate 1: Code Complete
- All checklist items marked complete
- All tests passing
- Coverage targets met
- No critical linting issues

### Gate 2: Integration Verified
- Integration tests passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- No regression in existing functionality
- Monitoring/metrics functional

### Gate 3: Documentation Complete
- All code documented
- User guides updated
- Architecture diagrams current
- Troubleshooting guide updated

### Gate 4: Review and Approval
- Code review completed
- Architecture review passed
- Security review (if applicable)
- Performance review passed

Only after all gates are passed should the milestone be tagged as complete and the next milestone begin.
