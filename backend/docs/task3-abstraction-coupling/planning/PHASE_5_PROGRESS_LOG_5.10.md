### Technical Decisions

1. **Metrics Architecture**: Used Prometheus format for standardization and ecosystem compatibility
2. **Tracing Fallback**: Implemented mock tracing when OpenTelemetry not available to avoid hard dependency
3. **Event Streaming**: In-memory implementation with queues for real-time debugging capabilities
4. **Correlation Context**: Used Python contextvars for automatic propagation across async boundaries

### Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**: 
   - Event history limited to 10,000 events
   - Automatic cleanup of old metrics data
   - Configurable retention periods

2. **CPU Efficiency**:
   - Background tasks run at intervals
   - Async processing throughout
   - Efficient data structures (deque, heaps)

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Prometheus endpoint caches metrics
   - Event stream uses buffered queues
   - Batch processing where applicable

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: OpenTelemetry optional dependency
   - **Solution**: Created fallback mock implementations maintaining same API

2. **Challenge**: Memory growth from event history
   - **Solution**: Implemented automatic cleanup with configurable retention

3. **Challenge**: Correlation ID propagation across threads
   - **Solution**: Created thread propagation helper with context capture

### Integration Points

- Metrics exposed via `/metrics` endpoint
- Event stream accessible via WebSocket subscription
- Visualization data available via REST endpoints
- Correlation IDs propagate through all layers

### Next Steps

- Implement Milestone 5.11: Resilience and Optimization
- Add distributed tracing backends (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Integrate with time-series databases for long-term storage

### Technical Decisions

1. **In-Memory First**: Started with in-memory implementation for simplicity and performance
2. **Priority Support**: Used heap data structure for efficient priority queue operations
3. **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
4. **Topic Routing**: MQTT-style wildcards for flexible subscription patterns

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Queue Operations**: O(log n) for priority queue, O(1) for FIFO
2. **Routing**: O(m) where m is number of registered routes
3. **Memory Usage**: Bounded queues prevent unlimited growth
4. **Concurrency**: Configurable limits on concurrent handlers

### Integration with Game System

1. **Game Events**: Specialized queue for game state changes
2. **Bot Processing**: Background task queue for AI calculations
3. **Broadcasting**: Integration with WebSocket broadcasting
4. **State Synchronization**: Event-driven state updates
