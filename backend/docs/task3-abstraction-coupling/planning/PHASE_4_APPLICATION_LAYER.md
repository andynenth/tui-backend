# Phase 4: Application Layer Implementation Plan

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNING  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 (Adapters) âœ… COMPLETE | Phase 2 (Events) âœ… COMPLETE | Phase 3 (Domain) âœ… COMPLETE  
**Objective**: Create application layer with use cases to orchestrate domain logic  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days  

## 1. Overview & Objective

### Purpose
Phase 4 introduces the application layer following clean architecture principles. This layer contains use cases (application services) that orchestrate domain entities and services to implement business workflows. The application layer acts as the coordinator between the API layer (adapters) and the domain layer, handling transaction boundaries, cross-cutting concerns, and complex workflows.

### Key Objectives
1. **Use Case Implementation**: Create use cases for all 22 adapter operations
2. **Domain Orchestration**: Coordinate domain entities and services to fulfill business requirements
3. **Transaction Management**: Define clear transaction boundaries for atomic operations
4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Handle authorization, validation, and error handling at application level
5. **Maintain Compatibility**: All changes behind adapters with zero frontend impact

### How It Fits the Overall Strategy
- **Phase 0**: Established testing infrastructure to verify behavior preservation âœ…
- **Phase 1**: Created adapter layer providing clean API boundaries âœ…
- **Phase 2**: Implemented event system for decoupled communication âœ…
- **Phase 3**: Extracted pure domain logic into entities and services âœ…
- **Phase 4**: Build application layer to orchestrate domain (THIS PHASE)
- **Phase 5**: Implement infrastructure layer with repositories
- **Phase 6**: Gradual cutover using feature flags
- **Phase 7**: Complete migration and cleanup

## 2. Scope Definition

### What WILL Be Done

1. **Use Case Creation (22 use cases)**
   ```
   backend/application/use_cases/
   â”œâ”€â”€ connection/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handle_ping.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mark_client_ready.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ acknowledge_message.py
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sync_client_state.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ room_management/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create_room.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ join_room.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leave_room.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ get_room_state.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ add_bot_player.py
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ remove_player.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ lobby/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ get_room_list.py
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ get_room_details.py
   â””â”€â”€ game/
       â”œâ”€â”€ start_game.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ declare_piles.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ play_pieces.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ request_redeal.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ accept_redeal.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ decline_redeal.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ handle_redeal_decision.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ mark_player_ready.py
       â””â”€â”€ leave_game.py
   ```

2. **Application Services**
   - `GameApplicationService`: High-level game operations
   - `RoomApplicationService`: Room lifecycle management
   - `LobbyApplicationService`: Room discovery and matchmaking
   - `ConnectionApplicationService`: Client connection management

3. **Application Interfaces**
   - Define interfaces for infrastructure services needed by use cases
   - Create DTOs for data transfer between layers
   - Implement request/response models for use cases

4. **Adapter Integration**
   - Update all 22 adapters to call use cases instead of legacy handlers
   - Implement feature flags for each use case
   - Add shadow mode comparison for validation

5. **Error Handling**
   - Application-specific exceptions
   - Error mapping to WebSocket error codes
   - Consistent error response format

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each use case
   - Integration tests for adapter-to-use-case flow
   - Contract tests to ensure WebSocket compatibility

### What Will NOT Be Done

1. **Repository Implementations**: Deferred to Phase 5
   - Use cases will use repository interfaces only
   - Actual persistence remains in legacy code

2. **Infrastructure Services**: Deferred to Phase 5
   - No new notification systems
   - No new metric collectors
   - Continue using existing infrastructure

3. **State Machine Refactoring**: Out of scope
   - Keep current state machine as infrastructure
   - Use cases coordinate with existing state machine

4. **Bot Strategy Extraction**: Deferred to later phase
   - Bot logic remains in current location
   - Focus on core game operations first

5. **WebSocket Protocol Changes**: Strictly forbidden
   - No changes to message formats
   - No new event types
   - 100% backward compatibility required

6. **Direct Database Access**: Not allowed
   - All persistence through repository interfaces
   - No SQL or direct storage operations

## 3. Alignment Check

### Connection to Phase 0
- âœ… Use comprehensive test suite to verify behavior preservation
- âœ… Run WebSocket contract tests after each use case
- âœ… Use golden master tests to validate outputs
- âœ… Performance benchmarks to track overhead

### Connection to Phase 1
- âœ… Each adapter maps to one or more use cases
- âœ… Adapters become thin delegation layers
- âœ… Feature flags control adapter behavior
- âœ… Shadow mode compares old vs new paths
- âœ… Maintains 44% performance overhead baseline

### Connection to Phase 2
- âœ… Use cases publish domain events
- âœ… Event handlers trigger infrastructure actions
- âœ… Events provide audit trail for use case execution
- âœ… Async event processing for notifications

### Connection to Phase 3
- âœ… Use cases orchestrate domain entities (Room, Game, Player)
- âœ… Call domain services (GameRules, ScoringService, TurnResolution)
- âœ… Work with value objects (Declaration, HandStrength, etc.)
- âœ… Respect aggregate boundaries defined in domain

### Preparation for Phase 5
- Define clear repository interfaces for infrastructure
- Identify all infrastructure service needs
- Document persistence requirements
- Prepare for repository implementations

## 4. Conflicts & Redundancy Review

### Identified Challenges

1. **Transaction Boundaries**
   - Current: Implicit transactions in state machine
   - Challenge: Defining explicit boundaries in use cases
   - Resolution: Each use case represents one transaction

2. **Event vs Direct Updates**
   - Current: Mix of direct updates and events
   - Challenge: Ensuring consistency
   - Resolution: Use cases always emit events, infrastructure reacts

3. **Authorization Placement**
   - Current: Scattered across handlers
   - Challenge: Centralizing without duplication
   - Resolution: Application layer handles all authorization

4. **Error Code Mapping**
   - Current: Hardcoded error responses
   - Challenge: Maintaining compatibility
   - Resolution: Error mapper service in application layer

### Documentation Updates Needed
1. Update `CLAUDE.md` with application layer patterns
2. Create `APPLICATION_LAYER_GUIDE.md` for developers
3. Update architecture diagrams
4. Document use case specifications
