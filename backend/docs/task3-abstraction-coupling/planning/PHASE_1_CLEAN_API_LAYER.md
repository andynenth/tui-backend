## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Create Feature Flag System
- [x] Create `backend/config/feature_flags.py` ✅ INTEGRATED IN ADAPTER SYSTEM
  ```python
  class FeatureFlags:
      USE_CLEAN_API_ADAPTER = False
      API_ADAPTER_PERCENTAGE = 10  # Route 10% through adapter
  ```
- [x] Add environment variable support for flags ✅
- [x] Create helper function to check if request should use adapter ✅
- [x] Test flag toggling without code changes ✅

### 2. Create Base Adapter Infrastructure
- [x] Create `backend/api/adapters/` directory ✅ DONE
- [x] Create `backend/api/adapters/base_adapter.py` ✅ PATTERN IMPLEMENTED
  ```python
  class BaseWebSocketAdapter:
      def __init__(self, legacy_handler):
          self.legacy_handler = legacy_handler
      
      async def handle_message(self, websocket, message):
          # Base routing logic
          pass
  ```
- [x] Implement message routing logic based on feature flags ✅

  - [x] Forward to legacy handler initially ✅
- [x] Create `backend/api/adapters/game_adapter.py` ✅ game_adapters.py
  - [x] Handle `start_game` message ✅
  - [x] Handle `play` message ✅
  - [x] Handle `declare` message ✅
  - [x] Forward to legacy handler initially ✅
- [x] Test each adapter with real WebSocket messages ✅

- [x] Add A/B testing metrics collection ✅

### 5. Create Command Pattern Foundation
- [ ] Create `backend/api/commands/` directory ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (switched to minimal intervention pattern)
- [ ] Create `backend/api/commands/base_command.py` ❌ NOT NEEDED
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class Command:
      room_id: str

### Frontend Compatibility Note
**CRITICAL**: The frontend uses WebSocket exclusively for all game operations. The adapter pattern MUST:
- Preserve exact message structure for all WebSocket events
- Maintain identical response formats
- Keep broadcast event names unchanged
- Preserve event ordering and timing
- Return same error formats

Example compatibility preservation:
```python
# Frontend sends: {"action": "declare", "data": {"player_name": "Alice", "value": 3}}
# Backend MUST respond with exact same format as current system
# No field renaming, no structure changes, no new required fields
```

**Remember**: The goal is not to replace the existing system yet, but to create a parallel path that we can gradually migrate to. Every step should be reversible, and the system should remain fully functional throughout the process.
