# Phase 3.1: Domain Entity Extraction - Progress Report

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  

## Completed Items ✅

### 1. Domain Directory Structure
Created the foundational directory structure:
```
backend/domain/
├── __init__.py
├── entities/         # Core business objects
├── value_objects/    # Immutable value types
├── services/         # Domain services
├── interfaces/       # Port interfaces
└── events/          # Domain events
    ├── base.py      # Base event classes
    └── player_events.py  # Player-specific events
```

### 2. Piece Value Object ✅
**File**: `domain/value_objects/piece.py`
- Immutable value object representing game pieces
- Encapsulates piece logic (comparison, validation)
- No infrastructure dependencies
- Factory methods for creation
- Full test coverage (12 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Frozen dataclass ensuring immutability
- Piece comparison methods
- Deck building logic
- Serialization support

### 3. Player Entity ✅
**File**: `domain/entities/player.py`
- Pure domain entity managing player state
- Event emission for all state changes
- No infrastructure concerns (removed connection tracking, avatar colors)
- Full test coverage (16 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Hand management with events
- Declaration and capture tracking
- Score and statistics management
- Round reset functionality
- Event-driven state changes

**Events Created**:
- `PlayerHandUpdated`
- `PlayerDeclaredPiles`
- `PlayerCapturedPiles`
- `PlayerScoreUpdated`
- `PlayerStatUpdated`

### 4. Game Entity ✅
**File**: `domain/entities/game.py`
- Pure domain entity managing game state and rules
- Turn and round management
- Phase transitions with events
- Full test coverage (24 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Game lifecycle management (start, rounds, end)
- Turn-based gameplay with validation
- Weak hand detection and redeal handling
- Scoring and win condition evaluation
- Event emission for all state changes

**Events Created**:
- `GameStarted`, `GameEnded`
- `RoundStarted`, `RoundCompleted`
- `PhaseChanged`
- `TurnStarted`, `TurnCompleted`, `TurnWinnerDetermined`
- `PiecesDealt`, `WeakHandDetected`, `RedealExecuted`

### 5. Room Aggregate Root ✅
**File**: `domain/entities/room.py`
- Aggregate root for the game bounded context
- Manages room lifecycle and player slots
- Host migration logic
- Full test coverage (20 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Room creation with auto-filled bot slots
- Player join/leave management
- Host migration when host leaves
- Room status tracking (WAITING, READY, IN_GAME, COMPLETED, ABANDONED)
- Game lifecycle management

**Events Created**:
- `RoomCreated`
- `PlayerJoinedRoom`, `PlayerLeftRoom`
- `HostMigrated`
- `RoomStatusChanged`
- `GameStartedInRoom`

## Completed Phase 3.1 ✅

## Test Results

```bash
# Piece value object tests
tests/domain/value_objects/test_piece.py: 12 passed ✅

# Player entity tests  
tests/domain/entities/test_player.py: 16 passed ✅

# Game entity tests
tests/domain/entities/test_game.py: 24 passed ✅

# Room aggregate root tests
tests/domain/entities/test_room.py: 20 passed ✅

Total: 72 tests passing
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Event-Driven State Changes**: All entity state changes emit domain events
2. **Immutable Value Objects**: Pieces are immutable for thread safety
3. **No Infrastructure**: Removed all WebSocket, persistence, and UI concerns
4. **Factory Methods**: Clean creation patterns for complex objects
5. **Serialization Support**: to_dict/from_dict for persistence layer

## Summary

Phase 3.1 is now complete! We have successfully extracted all core domain entities:

1. **Piece Value Object**: Immutable game piece representation
2. **Player Entity**: Player state and behavior management
3. **Game Entity**: Core game logic and rules
4. **Room Aggregate Root**: Top-level aggregate managing the bounded context

All entities follow Domain-Driven Design principles:
- Pure domain logic with no infrastructure dependencies
- Event-driven state changes for complete audit trails
- Immutable value objects for thread safety
- Rich domain models expressing business rules clearly
- Comprehensive test coverage (72 tests passing)

## Next Steps

Phase 3.1 is complete. Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 3.2: Domain Services (GameRules, ScoringService, etc.)
- Phase 3.3: Additional Value Objects
- Phase 3.4: Domain Interfaces
- Phase 3.5: Adapter Updates
- Phase 3.6: Integration Testing

## Architecture Benefits So Far

- **Testability**: Pure domain logic tests without mocks
- **Clarity**: Business rules clearly expressed in code
- **Flexibility**: Easy to change rules without affecting infrastructure
- **Events**: Complete audit trail of all state changes
