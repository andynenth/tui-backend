# Phase 2.2 Completion: Event-to-Broadcast Bridge

## Summary
Phase 2.2 is **COMPLETE**. The event-to-broadcast bridge has been implemented, providing a clean mapping between domain events and WebSocket messages while maintaining 100% compatibility.

## What Was Created

### 1. Event Broadcast Mapper
- **Central Registry**: Maps each event type to its WebSocket message format
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed mapping functions
- **Context Support**: Can include room state and other context in broadcasts
- **Exact Compatibility**: Preserves all field names and message structures

### 2. Broadcast Handlers
- **Initial Handlers**: Individual handlers for each event type (broadcast_handlers.py)
- **Mapping System**: Centralized event-to-broadcast mappings
- **Integrated Handler**: Single handler that processes all events

### 3. Key Features
- **Target Types**: Support for room, player, lobby, and response broadcasts
- **State Context**: Can include current room/game state in broadcasts
- **Error Isolation**: Handler failures don't affect other handlers
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with direct mapping

## Design Decisions

1. **Centralized Mapping**: All event-to-broadcast mappings in one place for consistency
2. **Context Pattern**: Pass additional context (room state, counters) to mappers
3. **Target Routing**: Different broadcast types (room, player, lobby) handled appropriately
4. **Compatibility First**: Every mapping preserves exact WebSocket message format

## Mapped Events

### Room Management
- RoomCreated → room_created (response)
- PlayerJoinedRoom → room_update (room broadcast)
- PlayerLeftRoom → room_update (room broadcast)
- HostChanged → host_changed (room broadcast)
- BotAdded → room_update (room broadcast)

### Game Flow
- GameStarted → game_started (room broadcast)
- PhaseChanged → phase_change (room broadcast)
- PiecesPlayed → turn_played (room broadcast)
- DeclarationMade → declare (room broadcast)
- TurnWinnerDetermined → turn_results (room broadcast)

### Scoring
- ScoresCalculated → score_update (room broadcast)
- GameEnded → game_ended (room broadcast)

### Other
- ConnectionHeartbeat → pong (response)
- InvalidActionAttempted → error (player message)
- RoomListUpdated → room_list_update (lobby broadcast)

## Integration Points

1. **Socket Manager**: Uses existing broadcast() function for room broadcasts
2. **Room Manager**: Can access room state for complete broadcasts
3. **Event Bus**: Subscribes to all relevant events automatically
4. **Adapters**: Ready to publish events instead of direct broadcasts

## Next Steps
Phase 2.3: Update all 22 adapters to publish events instead of making direct broadcast calls.
