# Phase 4.6 & 4.7 Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Components**: Game Flow Use Cases Part 2 + Application Services  

## Phase 4.6: Game Flow Use Cases Part 2 ✅

### Implemented Use Cases (7/7)

1. **RequestRedealUseCase**
   - Validates weak hand condition
   - Creates redeal voting session
   - Auto-accepts for other weak hands
   - Sets voting timeout
   - Emits RedealRequested & RedealVoteStarted

2. **AcceptRedealUseCase**
   - Records acceptance votes
   - Checks voting completion
   - Executes redeal if unanimous
   - Transitions to declaration phase
   - Emits multiple events (Accept, Approved, Executed, PiecesDealt)

3. **DeclineRedealUseCase**
   - Immediately cancels redeal
   - Makes decliner the starting player
   - Transitions to declaration phase
   - Emits Declined, Cancelled, StartingPlayerChanged

4. **HandleRedealDecisionUseCase**
   - Processes timeout scenarios
   - Treats missing votes as declines
   - Executes final decision
   - Comprehensive event emission

5. **MarkPlayerReadyUseCase**
   - Tracks readiness per phase transition
   - Triggers phase changes when all ready
   - Handles round transitions
   - Supports game completion flow

6. **LeaveGameUseCase**
   - Converts leaving player to bot
   - Maintains game continuity
   - Updates all references (declarations, votes, etc.)
   - Updates player statistics

### Redeal Flow Complexity
- **Voting System**: Complete implementation with timeout
- **Auto-Accept Logic**: Weak hand players automatically accept
- **Decliner Becomes Starter**: Game rule properly enforced
- **State Transitions**: Clean phase management

```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Redeal Flow**: Very high complexity with voting, timeout, and rules
- **Bot Orchestration**: Medium-high complexity across all services
- **Analytics**: Sophisticated metrics and pattern analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time connection tracking

## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Facade Pattern
- Application services provide simplified interfaces
- Hide use case complexity from adapters
- Orchestrate multiple operations

### 2. Strategy Pattern
- Bot behavior strategies
- Matchmaking algorithms
- Room recommendation scoring

### 3. Observer Pattern
- Health monitoring with thresholds
- Activity tracking
- Metric collection

### 4. Template Method
- Common service initialization
- Standard error handling
- Consistent logging

## Key Achievements

### Complete Application Layer ✅
- **22 Use Cases**: All adapter operations covered
- **4 Services**: High-level orchestration
- **Rich Features**: Analytics, matchmaking, health monitoring
- **Bot Integration**: Seamless AI player handling

### Architecture Benefits
- **Clean Separation**: Use cases for single operations, services for orchestration
- **Testability**: Each component independently testable
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify behaviors
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and analytics

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Transaction Management**: Clear boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Consistent exception hierarchy
- **Logging**: Structured logging throughout
- **Metrics**: Performance tracking built-in

## Integration Points

### With Domain Layer
- Orchestrates domain entities and services
- Respects aggregate boundaries
- Emits domain events properly

### With Infrastructure
- Uses repository interfaces
- Publishes events via interface
- No direct infrastructure coupling

### With Adapters
- Provides clean use case interfaces
- Returns DTOs for serialization
- Handles all business logic

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4.8**: Infrastructure Integration
   - Wire up adapters to use cases
   - Implement feature flags
   - Shadow mode validation

2. **Phase 4.9**: Testing & Validation
