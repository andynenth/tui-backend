# Phase 3.5: Domain Integration - Progress Report

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  

## Overview

Phase 3.5 successfully bridges the gap between the pure domain layer (Phase 3) and the existing WebSocket infrastructure. This phase creates the necessary adapters and infrastructure to use the domain layer in production.

## Components Created

### 1. Domain-Based Game Adapter ✅
**File**: `api/adapters/game_adapters_domain.py`

- **DomainGameAdapter**: Bridges WebSocket messages to domain operations
- Handles all game actions using domain entities and services
- Methods:
  - `handle_start_game`: Uses Room aggregate to start games
  - `handle_declare`: Creates Declaration value objects
  - `handle_play`: Validates plays with GameRules service
  - `handle_redeal_request`: Manages redeal through Game entity
  - `handle_redeal_decision`: Processes accept/decline decisions

### 2. Infrastructure Repositories ✅
**Directory**: `infrastructure/repositories/`

#### InMemoryRoomRepository
- Implements the RoomRepository interface
- Provides in-memory storage for Room aggregates
- Methods match domain interface exactly
- Ready for replacement with persistent storage

### 3. Event Infrastructure ✅
**Directory**: `infrastructure/events/`

#### InMemoryEventBus
- Central event distribution system
- Supports handler registration and event routing
- Handles both specific and global event subscriptions
- Singleton pattern for application-wide use

#### WebSocketEventPublisher  
- Converts domain events to WebSocket broadcasts
- Maps domain event types to WebSocket event names
- Integrates with existing broadcast infrastructure

### 4. Event Handlers ✅
**Directory**: `infrastructure/handlers/`

#### WebSocketBroadcastHandler
- Subscribes to domain events
- Converts them to WebSocket broadcasts
- Ensures real-time client updates
- Event type mappings for all domain events

### 5. Integration Module ✅
**File**: `api/adapters/domain_integration.py`

#### DomainIntegration Class
- Wires together all domain components
- Sets up repositories, event bus, and handlers
- Provides simple enable/disable mechanism
- Routes WebSocket messages to domain adapters

### 6. WebSocket Wrapper ✅
**File**: `api/adapters/domain_adapter_wrapper.py`

#### DomainAdapterWrapper
- Minimal integration point for ws.py
- Environment variable configuration
- Fallback to legacy on errors
- Status reporting for monitoring

## Integration Architecture

```
WebSocket Message
    ↓
domain_adapter_wrapper.try_handle_with_domain()
    ↓
DomainIntegration.handle_message()
    ↓
DomainGameAdapter.handle_*()
    ↓
Domain Layer (Entities, Services, Value Objects)
    ↓
Domain Events Published
    ↓
InMemoryEventBus
    ↓
WebSocketBroadcastHandler
    ↓
WebSocket Broadcasts to Clients
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable domain adapters
DOMAIN_ADAPTERS_ENABLED=true  # Default: false
```

### Usage in ws.py
```python
from api.adapters.domain_adapter_wrapper import domain_adapter_wrapper

# In websocket_endpoint, after message validation:
response = await domain_adapter_wrapper.try_handle_with_domain(
    websocket, message, room_id
)

if response is not None:
    await websocket.send_json(response)
    continue  # Skip legacy handling
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Clean Architecture ✅
- Domain layer remains pure with no infrastructure dependencies
- Infrastructure adapts to domain, not vice versa
- Clear boundaries between layers

### 2. Event-Driven Updates ✅
- All state changes emit domain events
- Infrastructure subscribes to events
- Automatic WebSocket broadcasts
- Complete audit trail

### 3. Gradual Migration ✅
- Can be enabled/disabled via environment variable
- Falls back to legacy on errors
- Allows testing in production safely
- Side-by-side operation possible

### 4. Testability ✅
- All components use interfaces
- Easy to mock for testing
- Repository pattern for data access
- Event bus for decoupling

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests in `tests/test_domain_integration.py`:
- Repository persistence operations
- Event bus publishing and routing
- Handler event processing
- Integration module wiring

## Migration Path

1. **Development Testing**
   - Set `DOMAIN_ADAPTERS_ENABLED=true`
   - Test all game operations
   - Monitor logs for errors

2. **Staging Rollout**
   - Enable for specific rooms
   - Compare with legacy behavior
   - Verify event broadcasts

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Gradual rollout by percentage
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Full cutover when stable

## Summary

Phase 3.5 successfully creates all infrastructure needed to use the domain layer in production. The integration is:

- **Non-invasive**: Minimal changes to existing code
- **Reversible**: Can disable instantly
- **Observable**: Full logging and status
- **Performant**: In-memory implementations
- **Extensible**: Easy to add persistence

With Phase 3.5 complete, the domain layer is now fully integrated and ready for use!
