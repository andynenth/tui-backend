# Phase 3.2: Domain Services Implementation - Progress Report

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  

## Completed Items ✅

### 1. Domain Services Directory Structure
Created the foundational directory:
```
backend/domain/services/
├── __init__.py
├── game_rules.py      # Game rules and validation
├── scoring_service.py # Score calculations
└── turn_resolution.py # Turn winner determination
```

### 2. GameRules Service ✅
**File**: `domain/services/game_rules.py`
- Pure domain service for game rules and validation
- No infrastructure dependencies
- Full test coverage (17 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Play type identification (SINGLE, PAIR, STRAIGHT, etc.)
- Play validation logic
- Play comparison for determining winners
- Declaration validation rules
- Weak hand detection
- Hand strength calculation

**Design Decisions**:
- Used static methods for stateless operations
- Created PlayType constants for type safety
- Encapsulated all game rules in one place
- Clear separation between validation and comparison

### 3. ScoringService ✅
**File**: `domain/services/scoring_service.py`
- Pure domain service for score calculations
- Encapsulates all scoring rules
- Full test coverage (11 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Base score calculation with all rules
- Round score calculation with multipliers
- Perfect round detection
- Final standings calculation
- Human-readable penalty reasons

**Value Objects Created**:
- `RoundScore`: Immutable score for one player in a round
- `RoundResult`: Complete scoring result for a round

### 4. TurnResolutionService ✅
**File**: `domain/services/turn_resolution.py`
- Pure domain service for turn resolution
- Determines turn winners based on plays
- Full test coverage (12 tests passing)

**Key Features**:
- Turn play validation
- Winner determination logic
- Required piece count enforcement
- Turn statistics calculation
- Human-readable summaries

**Value Objects Created**:
- `TurnPlay`: Immutable representation of a player's play
- `TurnResult`: Complete result of a turn

## Test Results

```bash
# GameRules service tests
tests/domain/services/test_game_rules.py: 17 passed ✅

# ScoringService tests
tests/domain/services/test_scoring_service.py: 11 passed ✅

# TurnResolutionService tests
tests/domain/services/test_turn_resolution.py: 12 passed ✅

# Total domain tests (including Phase 3.1)
Total: 112 tests passing ✅
```

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Pure Domain Services**: No infrastructure dependencies
2. **Static Methods**: Services are stateless
3. **Value Objects**: Immutable results and parameters
4. **Factory Methods**: Clean object creation (e.g., TurnPlay.create)
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: All rules encapsulated

## Architecture Benefits

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by any adapter
- **Maintainability**: Rules are centralized and documented
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with value objects

## Summary

Phase 3.2 is now complete! We have successfully implemented all core domain services:

1. **GameRules**: Validates plays and declarations
2. **ScoringService**: Calculates scores and standings
3. **TurnResolutionService**: Determines turn winners

All services follow Domain-Driven Design principles:
- Pure domain logic with no infrastructure
- Immutable value objects for data transfer
- Static methods for stateless operations
- Comprehensive test coverage (40 new tests)
- Clear, documented business rules

The domain layer now has a complete set of services that can be used by adapters to implement game functionality while maintaining clean architecture boundaries.
