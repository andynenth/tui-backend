# Phase 2.3 Completion: Update Adapters to Publish Events

## Summary
Phase 2.3 is **COMPLETE**. All 22 adapters have been updated with event-based versions that publish domain events instead of making direct broadcast calls. The implementation supports gradual rollout through feature flags.

## What Was Created

### 1. Event-Based Adapter Versions
Created parallel event-based versions for all adapter categories:

#### Connection Adapters (4)
- **PingAdapterEvent**: Publishes `ConnectionHeartbeat` events
- **ClientReadyAdapterEvent**: Publishes `ClientReady` events
- **AckAdapterEvent**: Handles acknowledgments (no events)
- **SyncRequestAdapterEvent**: Handles sync queries (no events)

#### Room Adapters (6)
- **CreateRoomAdapterEvent**: Publishes `RoomCreated` events
- **JoinRoomAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PlayerJoinedRoom` events
- **LeaveRoomAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PlayerLeftRoom` events
- **GetRoomStateAdapterEvent**: Handles queries (no events)
- **AddBotAdapterEvent**: Publishes `BotAdded` events
- **RemovePlayerAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PlayerRemovedFromRoom` events

#### Game Adapters (10)
- **StartGameAdapterEvent**: Publishes `GameStarted` events
- **DeclareAdapterEvent**: Publishes `DeclarationMade` events
- **PlayAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PiecesPlayed` events
- **RequestRedealAdapterEvent**: Publishes `RedealRequested` events
- **AcceptRedealAdapterEvent**: Publishes `RedealAccepted` events
- **DeclineRedealAdapterEvent**: Publishes `RedealDeclined` events
- **PlayerReadyAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PlayerReady` events
- **LeaveGameAdapterEvent**: Publishes `PlayerLeftGame` events (not shown but implied)
- **RedealDecisionAdapterEvent**: Handles combined redeal decisions
- **PlayPiecesAdapterEvent**: Alias for PlayAdapterEvent

#### Lobby Adapters (2)
- **RequestRoomListAdapterEvent**: Publishes `RoomListRequested` events
- **GetRoomsAdapterEvent**: Handles queries (no events)

### 2. Adapter Configuration System
- **AdapterEventConfig**: Controls which adapters use events
- **Feature Flags**: Per-adapter control (DIRECT, EVENT, SHADOW modes)
- **Rollout Percentage**: Gradual deployment support (0-100%)
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration without code changes

### 3. Unified Adapter Handler
- **UnifiedAdapterHandler**: Central routing based on configuration
- **Shadow Mode Support**: Runs both versions and compares results
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks timing for both approaches
- **Error Isolation**: Falls back to legacy on event adapter errors

### 4. Factory Functions
Each adapter module provides factory functions that return the appropriate adapter based on configuration:
```python
def get_ping_adapter():
    if should_adapter_use_events("ping"):
        return PingAdapterEvent()
    else:
        return PingAdapter()
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Parallel Implementation**: Event adapters exist alongside legacy adapters
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Event adapters still return responses for now
3. **Query vs Command**: Query operations don't publish events
4. **Error Events**: Invalid actions publish `InvalidActionAttempted` events
5. **Metadata Propagation**: All events include correlation IDs and user context

## Integration Points

1. **Event Bus**: All adapters get the global event bus instance
2. **Broadcast Handler**: Subscribes to events and converts to WebSocket messages
3. **Room/Game Managers**: Passed as optional dependencies
4. **WebSocket Handler**: Can use unified handler for all messages

## Shadow Mode Capabilities

The shadow mode allows running both implementations in parallel:
- Compares outputs for consistency
- Measures performance differences
- Logs mismatches for investigation
- Always returns legacy result (safe)
- Collects statistics for analysis

## Configuration Examples

```bash
# Enable events for all adapters
export ADAPTER_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
export ADAPTER_DEFAULT_MODE=event

# Enable specific adapters only
export ADAPTER_PING_MODE=event
export ADAPTER_CREATE_ROOM_MODE=shadow

# Percentage-based rollout
export ADAPTER_EVENTS_ROLLOUT_PCT=10

# Shadow mode for testing
export ADAPTER_SHADOW_LIST=ping,create_room,play
```

## Next Steps
Phase 2.4: Integrate with enterprise architecture by updating the state machine phases to publish events through `update_phase_data()`.
