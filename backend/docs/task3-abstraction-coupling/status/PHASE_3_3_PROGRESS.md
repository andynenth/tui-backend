# Phase 3.3: Value Objects Creation - Progress Report

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  

## Value Objects Created

### 1. Core Value Objects (Phase 3.1)
- **Piece** (`domain/value_objects/piece.py`) - Game piece representation
- **PlayerStats** (inline in Player entity) - Player statistics

### 2. Service Value Objects (Phase 3.2)
- **RoundScore** (`domain/services/scoring_service.py`) - Single player round score
- **RoundResult** (`domain/services/scoring_service.py`) - Complete round scoring
- **TurnPlay** (`domain/services/turn_resolution.py`) - Player's turn play
- **TurnResult** (`domain/services/turn_resolution.py`) - Complete turn result

### 3. Additional Value Objects (Phase 3.3)

#### Declaration Value Object ✅
**File**: `domain/value_objects/declaration.py`
- Immutable representation of player declarations
- Validation of pile count (0-8)
- Support for forced declarations
- Full test coverage (21 tests passing)

**Features**:
- `Declaration`: Single player's pile count declaration
- `DeclarationSet`: Complete set of declarations with validation
- Ensures total declarations never equal 8
- Factory methods with validation
- Serialization support

#### HandStrength Value Object ✅
**File**: `domain/value_objects/hand_strength.py`
- Immutable representation of hand strength
- Weak hand detection logic
- Hand comparison capabilities
- Full test coverage (18 tests passing)

**Features**:
- `HandStrength`: Analyzes and rates a single hand
- `HandComparison`: Compares multiple player hands
- Piece distribution analysis
- Strongest/weakest piece tracking
- Average value calculations

### 4. Existing Enumerations
- **GamePhase** (`domain/entities/game.py`) - Game state phases
- **WinConditionType** (`domain/entities/game.py`) - Win condition types
- **RoomStatus** (`domain/entities/room.py`) - Room states
- **PlayType** (`domain/services/game_rules.py`) - Valid play types

## Test Results

```bash
# Declaration value object tests
tests/domain/value_objects/test_declaration.py: 21 passed ✅

# HandStrength value object tests
tests/domain/value_objects/test_hand_strength.py: 18 passed ✅

# Total new tests in Phase 3.3
Total: 39 tests passing
```

## Value Objects Summary

### Total Value Objects Created:
1. **Piece** - Core game piece
2. **Declaration** - Player pile declaration
3. **DeclarationSet** - Round declarations
4. **HandStrength** - Hand evaluation
5. **HandComparison** - Multi-hand analysis
6. **RoundScore** - Player round score
7. **RoundResult** - Complete round result
8. **TurnPlay** - Single turn play
9. **TurnResult** - Complete turn result

### Key Design Patterns:
- **Immutability**: All value objects use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- **Factory Methods**: Clean creation with validation
- **Self-Validation**: Validation in `__post_init__`
- **Rich Behavior**: Methods for comparison and analysis
- **Serialization**: to_dict/from_dict for persistence

## Architecture Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents errors
- **Immutability**: Thread-safe by design
- **Encapsulation**: Business logic in the right place
- **Testability**: Pure value objects are easy to test
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code

## Summary

Phase 3.3 is complete! We have created all necessary value objects for the domain layer:
- Core value objects for game pieces
- Declaration handling with business rule enforcement
- Hand strength analysis for game logic
- All supporting value objects in services

The domain layer now has a rich set of immutable value objects that:
- Encapsulate business concepts clearly
- Enforce invariants at creation time
- Provide useful behavior and comparisons
- Support serialization for infrastructure
- Have comprehensive test coverage (151 total domain tests)
