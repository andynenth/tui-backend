## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing work | High | All changes are additive only |
| Missing edge cases | Medium | Port all tests from original |
| Performance impact | Low | Use existing patterns |
| Architectural inconsistency | Medium | Follow established patterns |

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Reconnection works identically to original ✅
2. ✅ Bot timing matches (0.5-1.5s delays) ✅
3. ✅ Message queues function correctly ✅
4. ✅ No regression in existing features ✅
5. ✅ Clean architecture maintained ✅
6. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for new code ✅

## Notes

- This is a critical recovery phase - cannot proceed to Phase 5 without it
- All changes must be backward compatible
- Focus on exact behavior matching, not improvements
- Document any deviations or discoveries
