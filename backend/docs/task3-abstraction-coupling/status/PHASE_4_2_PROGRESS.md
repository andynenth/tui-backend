# Phase 4.4 & 4.5 Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Components**: Lobby Use Cases + Game Flow Use Cases Part 1  

## Phase 4.4: Lobby Use Cases ✅

### Implemented Use Cases (2/2)

1. **GetRoomListUseCase**
   - Queries available rooms with filters
   - Supports sorting (by date, player count, name)
   - Paginated results
   - Checks player's current room
   - Filters: private rooms, full rooms, in-game

2. **GetRoomDetailsUseCase**
   - Comprehensive room information
   - Game settings and current state
   - Player statistics
   - Join eligibility evaluation
   - Privacy enforcement

### Key Features
- **Filtering**: Multiple filter options for room discovery
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large room lists
- **Join Validation**: Pre-checks before attempting to join
- **Statistics**: Optional player stats for competitive insight

## Phase 4.5: Game Flow Use Cases Part 1 ✅

### Implemented Use Cases (3/3)

1. **StartGameUseCase**
   - Validates room readiness (2+ players)
   - Host-only operation
   - Creates Game entity
   - Deals initial pieces
   - Detects weak hands
   - Optional seat shuffling
   - Emits multiple events (GameStarted, RoundStarted, PiecesDealt, WeakHandDetected)

2. **DeclareUseCase**
   - Declaration phase validation
   - Enforces "total ≠ 8" rule for last player
   - Tracks all declarations
   - Auto-transitions to turn phase
   - Emits PlayerDeclaredPiles event
   - Phase change orchestration

3. **PlayUseCase**
   - Turn validation (correct player)
   - Piece ownership verification
   - Play legality checks (GameRules)
   - Turn winner determination
   - Round completion handling
   - Game completion detection
   - Comprehensive event emission

### Domain Integration
- **Entities Used**: Game, Player, Room, Piece
- **Services Used**: GameRules, TurnResolutionService
- **Events Emitted**: 11 different event types
- **Validation**: Multi-level (request, domain rules, state)

## Metrics

### Code Statistics
```
Lobby Use Cases:
- Use cases: 2 files, ~400 lines
- DTOs: 1 file, ~150 lines

Game Flow Use Cases Part 1:
- Use cases: 3 files, ~850 lines
- DTOs: 1 file (partial), ~200 lines

Total Phase Progress: ~1,600 lines
Running Total: ~5,250 lines of application code
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **StartGameUseCase**: High complexity (initialization, dealing, events)
- **DeclareUseCase**: Medium complexity (rules, phase transition)
- **PlayUseCase**: Very high complexity (validation, resolution, completion)

## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Command Pattern
- Each use case as a command with execute()
- Clear request/response contracts
- Encapsulated business operations

### 2. Domain Event Pattern
- Rich events with full context
- Decoupled notification system
- Event-driven state transitions

### 3. Validation Pipeline
- Request validation
- Domain rule validation
- State consistency checks

### 4. Transaction Script
- Each use case as one transaction
- Clear boundaries
- Atomic operations

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4.6**: Game Flow Use Cases Part 2 (7 remaining use cases)
   - Request/Accept/Decline Redeal
   - Handle Redeal Decision
   - Mark Player Ready
   - Leave Game
   
2. **Phase 4.7**: Application Services
3. **Phase 4.8**: Infrastructure Integration

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Core game loop implemented (start → declare → play)
- ✅ Complex game state transitions handled
- ✅ Full event emission for state changes
- ✅ Domain services properly orchestrated
- ✅ Zero infrastructure dependencies maintained

## Notes

The three game flow use cases form the core gameplay loop. They demonstrate:
- Proper domain orchestration
- Complex state management
- Multi-phase coordination
- Event-driven architecture

All use cases maintain clean separation from infrastructure while providing rich functionality through domain orchestration.
