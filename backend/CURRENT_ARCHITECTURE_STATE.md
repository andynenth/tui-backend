# Current Architecture State (Post-Phase 6)

## üéØ TL;DR
- **Clean architecture is ACTIVE** via adapter-only mode
- **Legacy code still EXISTS but is NOT EXECUTED** for business logic
- **Warnings in logs are COSMETIC** - the system works correctly

## üìä What's Actually Running

### ‚úÖ Clean Architecture (Active)
All business logic flows through clean architecture adapters:
- Room management ‚Üí `api.adapters.room_adapters`
- Game actions ‚Üí `api.adapters.game_adapters`
- Lobby operations ‚Üí `api.adapters.lobby_adapters`
- Connection handling ‚Üí `api.adapters.connection_adapters`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy Components (Present but Bypassed)
These initialize at startup but are NOT used for business logic:
- `shared_room_manager` (AsyncRoomManager)
- `shared_bot_manager` (BotManager)
- Legacy handlers in ws.py (after line 327)
- `socket_manager.py` reliable messaging

### üîÑ Hybrid Infrastructure
- `ws.py` - Acts as WebSocket infrastructure, routes to adapters
- Lines 316-327 in ws.py - The adapter integration point
- Everything else in ws.py - Legacy code that's never reached

## üö¶ How Traffic Flows

```
1. WebSocket message arrives at ws.py
2. ws.py passes to adapter_wrapper (lines 318-320)
3. Adapter system handles with clean architecture
4. Response sent back to client
5. Legacy handlers (line 328+) are NEVER reached
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why You See Warnings

The warnings like "Room not found in AsyncRoomManager" occur because:
1. Clean architecture creates rooms in its own repositories
2. Legacy AsyncRoomManager doesn't know about these rooms
3. When ws.py checks room existence (line 281), it uses legacy manager
4. This causes warnings but NO functional issues

## üéÆ Is It Working Correctly?

**YES!** The logs prove it:
- `api.adapters.room_adapters - INFO - Room created: room_972b7ed4`
- `ADAPTER-ONLY MODE ENABLED: No legacy fallback!`
- All game operations work through clean architecture

## üìù What's Left to Do

**Phase 7: Legacy Code Removal** (Not yet executed)
- Remove unused legacy components
- Clean up initialization code
- Eliminate the warnings
- Full separation of concerns

## üîß Configuration

Current setup in `start.sh`:
```bash
# These enable adapter routing (critical)
export ADAPTER_ENABLED=true
export ADAPTER_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=100

# These are for internal clean architecture components
export FF_USE_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE=true
# ... other FF flags
```

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Why not remove legacy code now?**
A: Phase 6 focused on migration. Phase 7 handles safe removal with proper testing.

**Q: Are the warnings a problem?**
A: No, they're cosmetic. The system works correctly.

**Q: Is ws.py legacy?**
A: No, it's infrastructure. The legacy parts inside it are bypassed.

**Q: Can I disable legacy initialization?**
A: Possible but risky. Better to wait for Phase 7's systematic approach.

**Q: How do I identify if a file is legacy or clean?**
A: See [Legacy vs Clean Identification Guide](./docs/task3-abstraction-coupling/implementation/guides/LEGACY_VS_CLEAN_IDENTIFICATION_GUIDE.md) or use `python tools/identify_architecture_type.py`
