### **Architecture Validation Standards**

1. **Evidence-Based Claims**: All architectural statements should have code references
2. **Line Number Verification**: Specific line claims should be validated through code inspection
3. **Integration Testing**: Cross-layer flows should be verified through actual execution
4. **Assumption Marking**: Clearly mark theoretical vs verified architectural patterns

### **Future Validation Process**

1. **Automated Verification**: Consider tools to validate architectural claims against code
2. **Regular Updates**: Architecture documentation should track actual implementation changes
3. **Evidence Standards**: Establish minimum evidence requirements for architectural claims
