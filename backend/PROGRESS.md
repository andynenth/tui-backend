### ⚡ **NEW Technical Patterns Implemented**
```python
# Entity Lifecycle Management with State Machines
class Room:

        # Business rule validation + state transition
        if self.status != RoomStatus.FULL:
            raise ValueError("Cannot start game: room not full")
        self.status = RoomStatus.IN_GAME
        return Game(max_players=len(self.players))

# Immutable State Snapshots with Factory Methods
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class GameState:
    players: List[PlayerState]
    turn_state: TurnState
    phase: GamePhase
    snapshot_at: datetime
    
    @classmethod
    def create_initial_state(cls, players: List[Player]) -> 'GameState':
        return cls(
            players=[PlayerState.from_player(p) for p in players],
            turn_state=TurnState.create_waiting(),
            phase=GamePhase.WAITING,
            snapshot_at=datetime.now()
        )

# Complex Value Object Composition
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PlayerState:
    name: str
    score: int
    hand_size: int
    is_bot: bool
    
    @classmethod
    def from_player(cls, player: Player) -> 'PlayerState':
        return cls(
            name=player.name,
            score=player.score,
            hand_size=len(player.hand) if player.hand else 0,
            is_bot=player.is_bot
        )
```
