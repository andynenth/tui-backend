🟢 Domain Layer (4/15 files) - 27% Complete

 entities/player.py ✅ COMPLETED - Clean entity with business logic
 entities/test_player.py ✅ COMPLETED - Test coverage established
 entities/piece.py ✅ COMPLETED - Immutable value object with game rules
 value_objects/game_phase.py ✅ COMPLETED - Phase transitions & validation
 entities/game.py ⏭️ NEXT PRIORITY - Aggregate root
 entities/room.py
 value_objects/game_state.py
 value_objects/play_result.py
 interfaces/bot_strategy.py ⏭️ NEXT PRIORITY - First interface (ABC pattern)
 interfaces/game_repository.py
 interfaces/event_publisher.py

Domain Status: ✅ Zero dependency violations | ✅ All tests passing | ✅ Pure business logic

📊 Overall Progress Summary
Total Progress: 5/40 files (12.5%) 🟢
✅ Completed This Session

Player Entity - Identity, state management, business methods
Piece Value Object - Immutable game pieces with comparison logic
GamePhase Value Object - Game flow with transition validation
Testing Foundation - Test-first development approach
Architecture Governance - Automated compliance checking

🎯 Current Focus: Domain Layer Foundation
Goal: Complete pure business logic layer with zero external dependencies
⏭️ Next 3 Priorities

domain/interfaces/bot_strategy.py - Learn Python ABC pattern for interfaces
domain/entities/game.py - The aggregate root that orchestrates gameplay
domain/entities/room.py - Multi-player game management


🏆 Milestones & Achievements
🎉 Milestone 1: Domain Foundation (20% Complete)

 First entity with business logic ✅
 First value object with immutability ✅
 Game flow validation ✅
 Zero dependency violations ✅
 First interface (ABC pattern) ⏭️ Next
 Aggregate root entity ⏭️ Next

🚀 Upcoming Milestones

Milestone 2: Domain Complete (Target: 15/15 files)
Milestone 3: First Use Case (Application layer start)
Milestone 4: Infrastructure Wiring (Dependency injection)
Milestone 5: Full Migration (All 40 files complete)


📈 Recent Session Impact
🧠 IT Infrastructure Concepts Learned

Entities vs Value Objects - Identity vs value-based equality
Domain Purity - Zero external dependencies in business logic
Immutable Design - frozen=True dataclasses for value objects
Encapsulated Logic - Business rules live with domain objects
Automated Governance - Scripts enforce architectural boundaries

⚡ Technical Patterns Implemented
python# Entity Pattern (mutable, has identity)
@dataclass
class Player:
    def add_to_score(self, points: int) -> None:
        self.score += points

# Value Object Pattern (immutable, value-based identity)  
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Piece:
    def can_beat(self, other: 'Piece') -> bool:
        return self.value > other.value

# Enum with Business Logic
class GamePhase(Enum):
    def can_transition_to(self, next_phase) -> bool:
        return next_phase in VALID_TRANSITIONS[self]
🔥 Breakthrough Moments

✨ Entity vs Value Object clicked - Two Player("Alice") are different, two Piece(5, RED) are same
✨ Domain logic belongs in domain - piece.can_beat() makes perfect sense
✨ Zero dependencies enables testing - Can test business logic without FastAPI/DB


🎯 Next Session Goals
Primary Objectives (Next 2-3 hours)

Create domain/interfaces/bot_strategy.py

Learn Python ABC (Abstract Base Class) pattern
Define interface for bot implementations
Document interface pattern learned


Begin domain/entities/game.py

Design the aggregate root
Coordinate players, pieces, phases
Implement core game orchestration logic


Architecture Validation

Run python backend/scripts/check_architecture.py
Ensure zero dependency violations maintained
Document any new patterns discovered



Learning Research

 Python ABC pattern for interfaces
 Aggregate root design principles
 When to create new entities vs extend existing ones

Stretch Goals

 Create domain/entities/room.py if time permits
 Begin planning first use case in application layer
 Update CONFIDENCE.md with interface learnings


🚧 Current Blockers & Dependencies
No Current Blockers ✅
All domain work can proceed independently
Upcoming Dependencies

Application Layer ⏳ Needs domain interfaces complete
Infrastructure Layer ⏳ Needs domain interfaces to implement
Presentation Layer ⏳ Needs application use cases ready

Research Needed

Python Abstract Base Classes (ABC) for interface definitions
Aggregate root patterns in Domain-Driven Design
Dependency injection without framework containers


💡 Architecture Health Status
✅ Compliance Dashboard

Domain Purity: ✅ Zero external dependencies
Layer Boundaries: ✅ No violations detected
Test Coverage: ✅ Tests exist for all entities
Business Logic: ✅ Properly encapsulated in domain
Immutability: ✅ Value objects are frozen

📊 Quality Metrics

Circular Imports: 🟢 None in new architecture
Code Complexity: 🟢 Simple, focused classes
Testability: 🟢 Easy to test in isolation
Maintainability: 🟢 Clear separation of concerns
