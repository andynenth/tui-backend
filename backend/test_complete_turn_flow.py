üéÆ Complete Turn Phase Flow Test

Tests the entire turn phase flow from start to end round according to TURN_PHASE_DIAGRAM.md

This test validates:
1. Turn Phase Start - Set first turn starter based on round starter
2. New Turn - Start new turn with proper order
3. Starter Play - Starter plays 1-6 pieces and sets piece count
4. Validation - Starter's play must be valid
5. Set Piece Count - Required count set for other players
6. Others Play - Other players must match piece count
7. Collect Plays - All players participate
8. Determine Winner - Correct winner calculation
9. Winner Takes Piles - Pile distribution
10. Update Score - Pile count tracking
11. Check Next Turn - Continue or transition to scoring
12. Next Turn Starter - Winner starts next turn
13. Round Complete - All hands empty triggers scoring phase
