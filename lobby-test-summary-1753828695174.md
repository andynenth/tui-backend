... and 4 more events


🐛 BUG DIAGNOSIS:
The lobby auto-update is NOT working correctly. Here's what we observed:

1. Andy created a room successfully
2. Alexanderium should have seen the room appear automatically
3. Room list update events: 6
4. Backend is sending room_list_update events

LIKELY CAUSES:
- Frontend is not processing room_list_update events correctly
- UI update issues
- State management problems

RECOMMENDED FIXES:
1. Check backend room broadcast logic
2. Verify WebSocket event handling
3. Debug frontend state updates
4. Test WebSocket connection stability
